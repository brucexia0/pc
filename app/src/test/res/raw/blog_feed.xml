            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Government Shutdown 2019</h1>
<p>We have now experienced the longest government shutdown on record. This has disrupted nine Federal Departments, and if a Federal worker is deemed “essential” they must work without pay, while others are either furloughed or placed on temporary leave. While the shutdown is undoubtedly affecting many people&#8217;s lives, another question we are getting is: how does a government shutdown, especially one as long as this, impact the overall economy?</p>
<p><code><br />
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-QVpSDHQTc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></code></p>
<h2>Does it Impact the Overall Economy?</h2>
<p>So far, it has had minimal impact on the overall US economy, but there has been a clear disruption in certain pockets of the economy and significant impacts on the individual government workers affected. Eventually the market would not be able to ignore it. Some estimates show a 0.5% hit to GDP if the shutdown lasts through January.</p>
<p>History has shown past shutdowns have had very little impact on stock markets, but the longer this shutdown lingers, the more the risks increase.  We are continuing to monitor the situation, but are cautiously optimistic the situation will be resolved with minimal market impact. If it lasts into February we expect it would start to cause more volatility into already jittery markets, but would remain just one factor.  </p>
<p>If the shutdown lasts into February, it may cause more <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/whitepapers/investors-guide-to-volatile-markets/">volatility</a>.  </p>
<h2>The Importance of an Emergency Fund</h2>
<p>During the course of this shutdown, many government workers have gone without pay. Unexpected events that affect our cashflow <em>can</em> happen &#8212; and this is why it&#8217;s so important to have an emergency fund. Personal Capital generally recommends that people have around 3-6 months of funds available to them for a &#8220;just-in-case&#8221; scenario. Generally, an FDIC-insured savings vehicle with a meaningful interest rate is a good place to house emergency funds. High yield savings accounts and bonds provide significantly higher returns than a checking or low yield savings account. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Major US indices strung together a fourth straight week of gains and finished the week strong on optimism over US and China trade negotiations.  Financials were the strongest performing sector for the week with several of the major US banks reporting earnings to kick off the start of earnings season.  However, the most notable event of the week was the duel for the most dysfunctional government display which continues to take place on both sides of the pond.  The US government shutdown started the week by breaking a record for longest on record, now entering day 28.  The US was the clear front runner, until UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal made history as the largest ever government defeat on the floor of the House of Commons, which lost by a staggering 230 votes.  If there were any doubts on who deserved the crown, Britain followed that up with a vote of no confidence on whether the existing government should continue, in which May barely survived. </p>
<h2>Weekly Returns</h2>
<p>S&#038;P 500: 2671 (2.87%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US (VEU): (1.81%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.79% (.08%)<br />
Gold: $1,281 (-0.49%)<br />
EUR/USD: 1.1368 (-0.88%)</p>
<h2>Major Events</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monday – PG&#038;E announced plans to file for bankruptcy citing massive potential liability from the recent California wildfires.</li>
<li>Tuesday – UK Prime Minister Teresa May’s proposed Brexit deal lost by 230 votes, which made it the largest defeat for a sitting gov’t by British Parliament in history.</li>
<li>Tuesday – Large Banks kicked off the start to earnings season reporting mixed results.</li>
<li>Wednesday – May survived a “vote of no confidence” put forth by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn by a slim margin.</li>
<li>Wednesday – President Trump signed the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, a bill that requires the compensation of government employees affected by the ongoing US government shutdown.</li>
<li>Thursday – Netflix reported fourth-quarter earnings of a slight revenue miss and earnings beat with strong subscriber growth numbers, which caused the stock to trade down about 3% in after-hours trading.</li>
<li>Friday – Trade optimism lifted markets after a report surfaced late Thursday that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was considering lifting some or all tariffs imposed on Chinese imports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Negotiations for funding the US government have been at a standstill over border wall funding and disagreements about when to reopen the government.  This has disrupted nine Federal Departments, specifically (over 800,000 federal workers) the Departments of: Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, State, Transportation, and Treasury.  Despite what looked like some signs of concession this week, there have not been any significant developments to suggest much progress. </p>
<p>President Trump has already stated he won’t sign a bill unless the border wall funding is included.  Eventually, someone will cave to political pressures and will budge as this has a real effect on people’s lives.  Either there will need to be compromising from one or both sides, or Democrats and Republicans could band together to pass a spending bill with a veto-proof majority to fund the government without Trump’s approval, which seems the least likely.  </p>
<p>So far, the shutdown has had minimal impact on the overall US economy, but there is clear disruption in certain pockets of the economy and significant impacts on the individual government workers affected.  The White House recently doubled its own estimate of the economic growth impact from the shutdown estimating it would now trim first quarter GDP by .5% if it lasts through the end of January, which appears to be on the higher end of estimates.  However, many people are not receiving paychecks, some key economic data figures are not being reported, and pain is being felt by many.  If these things continue for too long, eventually there would be a larger impact on the economy and the market would not be able to ignore it.  History has shown past shutdowns have had very little impact on stock markets, but the longer this shutdown lingers, the more the risks increase.  While we are cautiously optimistic there will be a resolution in the coming weeks and we do not foresee a significant impact on the broader economy, there is still a real risk there could be if a resolution is not reached soon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, across the pond, the UK is scheduled to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019.  A European court ruled that the UK can stop the process, or it can be extended if all 28 EU members agree. However, Theresa May already put it into British law, so stopping Brexit would require a change in law.  The biggest risk for Brexit would be a “hard Brexit”, meaning no deal and the UK leaving the EU without access to the EU’s single market and customs union.  Fear of this is May’s best leverage in negotiating a deal, so she is unlikely to remove this potential outcome in negotiations.  If a hard Brexit did happen it would be a significant blow to the UK economy and ultimately spill over into Europe.  </p>
<p>Equity and currency markets appear to be pricing in a soft Brexit as the likely outcome with the British pound rallying throughout the week and global markets posting a solid week of returns.  It is worth mentioning that this week’s developments reaffirm that a hard Brexit is still a real risk for the UK.  There is also still a small but notable chance that it goes back to vote and there is no Brexit, which would likely be Bullish for markets.  Ultimately, we think the most likely scenario will be a negotiated exit, and the UK will be able to avoid a hard Brexit. If they don’t, they would likely face a self-induced, potentially devastating impact on the British economy.  Not only would it impact trade, but a hard Brexit might also result in companies relocating from the UK to be a part of the European Union and cause major disruption in Britain’s currency and capital markets.  The UK is the 5th largest economy in the world, so the global impact would be noticeable, but not enough to cause a global recession on its own.  However, this sort of instability would be particularly concerning in what appears to be a larger theme of slowing global growth.  We will continue to monitor these events for new developments. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like most people, you’ve probably wondered, “How much income will I need during my retirement years?”. You’ve also probably wondered why you never seem to run across an answer to that ubiquitous question. So how much do you need to ensure you can retire comfortably?</p>
<h2>Why the Answer is Hard to Find</h2>
<p>There is endless information about building a <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/nest-egg-consolidated-investment-strategy/">retirement nest egg</a> and almost nothing about how big that nest egg should be. Two common reasons why the size of your nest egg is the subject of endless debate include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount is different for everyone because a “comfortable” retirement is entirely subjective</li>
<li>No one can agree on how much of your nest egg you can spend each year to sustain a comfortable retirement</li>
</ul>
<p>As an individual, the first reason is straightforward and can be answered relatively easily. On your own, or with the help of a <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management">financial advisor</a>, you can develop an estimate with some back-of-the envelope math.</p>
<h2>What to Consider When Determining Your Retirement</h2>
<p>First you must decide what you consider a “comfortable” retirement. This answer is, of course, different for everyone. But with a little addition and some simple multiplication, you now have a reasonably accurate estimate of your required annual income needs in retirement.<br />
Some basic things to consider when calculating how much you need for retirement include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic Needs</strong>: If you want a basic income to cover those needs, then you should identify your monthly necessities and multiply by 12. These items include: mortgage, groceries, insurance, utilities, car payments, and other expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Added Luxuries</strong>: If you want more luxuries, you should define the specific desired activities and estimate their approximate costs based on frequency, equipment needed, or any other related. These costs should be added to your monthly budget. Examples of these luxuries can include hobbies, a vacation home, a boat, and travel.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation</strong>: Additionally, you’ll need to consider inflation. There is plenty of information available to help establish a reasonable inflation estimate, but 3-4% is a good long-term inflation number you can use for your calculations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Challenges of Predicting the Future</h2>
<p>There is more to retirement planning; however, it’s not often so easy to calculate. To decide how much you can spend each year to <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/how-to-build-sustain-the-retirement-lifestyle-you-want/">sustain your retirement</a>, you need to know how long you will live in retirement and how much your investment portfolio will earn. If you retire at 65 and die at 80, you’ll need income for 15 years. What happens if you live to be 100? You don’t want to live without resources for 20 years. So, how much will your investment portfolio earn? That depends on stock market/economic conditions and the asset mix in your portfolio. You’ll also need to consider other individualized factors, such as how long you will work, social security, pensions, home equity and, of course, financial market cycles during your retirement years.<br />
Now you can see why the “how-much” question generates endless debate. How long you will live and how much your portfolio will earn are simply unanswerable questions.</p>
<h2>The “4% Rule”</h2>
<p>For more than 20 years, financial professionals have been loosely guided by what is called the 4% rule. If you follow this rule, you withdraw 4% of your portfolio in the first year of retirement and then you annually withdraw that same dollar amount, adjusted for inflation, for the next 30 years. The idea is that if you follow this rule, you minimize your chances of running out of money in retirement.</p>
<p><code><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gfIeZsN3bJc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></code></p>
<p>While this rule is a good starting point, it has been hotly debated since it was established. Some argue that it is too conservative. Others argue that today’s low-interest environment and longer life expectancies make it too risky. Meanwhile, your financial future hangs in the balance. If the rule is too conservative, then you’ve unnecessarily constrained your retirement lifestyle. If the rule is too risky, you could run out of money just when you need it most.</p>
<h2>The Definitive Answer to an Indefinable Problem</h2>
<p>While the debate rages on, there is a one-word answer to this how-much question: flexibility.<br />
And while it would be convenient to have a magic number to shoot for, that number is going to fluctuate constantly throughout your life based on a multitude of factors. So, the best answer is to maintain your flexibility—beginning when you are young by ensuring the decisions you make allow you to have more flexibility when you are in retirement. Review your retirement annually, consult with your financial advisor, ask questions, and be open to changes based on both individual and outside factors.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>The Jeff Bezos Divorce &#038; Its Potential Financial Implications</h1>
<p>Last week, Amazon CEO and the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos, announced that he and his wife Mackenzie Bezos are filing for divorce. They were married for 25 years and tied the knot before Mr. Bezos amassed his fortune with the founding of Amazon. </p>
<p>Many have speculated as to whether or not the couple had any sort of pre or post nuptial arrangement &#8212; there is simply no way to know. But whether or not they had a prenup, Jeff Bezos is still likely to lose 50% of his fortune in the divorce since most prenuptial arrangements only cover the assets that exist when you enter into a marriage. Whatever you earn while you are married is split 50/50 in many states, including Washington (where the Bezos’s are filing for divorce) which is a community property state. Postnuptial agreements can cover assets gained after marriage, but they are less common than prenups.</p>
<p>This situation raises the importance of considering <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/whitepapers/guide-marriage-weddings-and-money/">marriage from a financial planning perspective</a>, and that begins with not going into it with rose-colored glasses. Marriages often end in divorce. Jeff and Mackenzie are presenting a united and amicable front, but whether or not a divorce is amicable, the process is grueling both personally and financially. And it’s even harder if you don’t have any arrangements in place to define what happens to assets accumulated by each spouse during the marriage.</p>
<h2>Why Prenups Are Important &#038; Who Should Have One</h2>
<p>While we never go into a marriage wanting it to fail, being prepared for that potential outcome is an important step to take. A well-written prenup is a great way to ensure that both partners are on the same page when entering into a marriage, and ultimately protect the wishes of both parties if a divorce should take place. Prenup agreements can be customized and are different in each state, so make sure you discuss your specific circumstances with your financial advisor and <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/category/legacy-estate-planning/">estate planning</a> attorney.</p>
<p>We often get asked as advisors: who should have a prenup? Am I a good candidate for one? The answer is almost always yes. It’s a common misconception that prenups are just for couples who come into a marriage with one spouse being significantly wealthier than the other. However, a prenup is something almost any couple with assets or debts should consider, even if they are on a relatively level playing field. If one person in a marriage has major debts and the other does not, for example, a prenup can provide guidance on who is responsible for those debts going forward.</p>
<h2>More Important Than A Prenup: Talking About Money as a Couple</h2>
<p>I am frequently surprised how often we talk to people who have no idea what their partner or spouse holds in terms of assets or wealth. Many people we talk to are also not aligned with their partner on saving and spending priorities.</p>
<p>Couples will almost always have differing perspectives on money to some degree, and not talking to your partner about money can have serious consequences. Outside of “basic incompatibility” and infidelity, money is the number one cause of divorce. But usually it’s not actually money that causes the rift, it’s not being on the same page about money and not talking about it. </p>
<p>When you get married, you are legally tying yourself to another person, so it’s important to understand not only their financial situation, but also their attitude towards money in general. Here are some basic discussions you should consider having with your partner:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level-setting on the current state of your individual assets/wealth</li>
<li>Any expected future windfall events such as an inheritance or unvested options (for example, the Bezos children will probably want to put a provision in their own prenups regarding their inheritance)</li>
<li>Sit down and set a budget together and discuss how to treat both necessary and discretionary spending. Do you have a joint account? Do you keep your finances separate?</li>
<li>What are your financial priorities? Saving for a child’s education? Buying a second home? Early retirement?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Financial Consequences of Divorce</h2>
<p>Divorce can be very expensive from not only a division of assets perspective, but divorcing couples can often face hefty tax bills if they liquidate taxable investment accounts, which are taxed as capital gains. Spousal support can also be expensive and complicated if it was not addressed in a prenup. Spousal support differs by state and even by judge, but oftentimes the resource-providing spouse will be the one facing a heftier financial burden. This can get complicated, as income at the time of the divorce does not always correlate with personal net worth. Legal costs associated with divorce are another financial implication of parting ways with a spouse.</p>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Although we never want or expect a marriage to end in divorce, planning ahead is your best line of defense against the financial hardships associated with it. You don’t need to be marrying someone of different financial standing than yourself to talk about the possibility of a prenuptial agreement &#8211; most couples are good candidates for exploring one. And drawing up a prenup gives people a chance to do what is most important for the health of a relationship from a financial standpoint: talk about money.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Global equities continued their upward march on the back of last week’s positive jobs report and dovish comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Trade talks between China and U.S. also showed signs of progress, adding fuel to the rally. The positive momentum was enough to overcome a few negative reports from retailers, allowing equities to finish nicely positive for the week. Gold was relatively flat while commodities moved higher on rebounding oil prices. </p>
<h2>Weekly Returns</h2>
<p>S&#038;P 500: 2,596 (+2.6%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US (VEU): (+2.1%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.69% (+0.02%)<br />
Gold: $1,288 (+0.2%)<br />
USD/EUR: $1.146 (+0.6%)</p>
<h2>Major Events</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monday – The U.S. and China kicked off a new round of trade talks, hoping to flesh out details on important issues such as IP protection and subsidies.</li>
<li>Tuesday – Reports surfaced that the U.S. and China were making positive progress in their discussions, helping push global markets higher.</li>
<li>Wednesday – The most recent Fed minutes showed the central bank will be flexible and could be close to ending its series of rate increases.</li>
<li>Wednesday – Negotiations between Democrats and President Trump over border wall funding fell apart, extending the partial government shutdown.</li>
<li>Thursday – Macy’s, as well as a number of other retailers, reported weaker than expected post-holiday sales.</li>
<li>Friday – A sales director for Huawei Technologies was arrested in Poland on charges of high-level espionage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Is the selloff over? Maybe. Maybe not. But as we’ve pointed out before, it’s felt more like a correction than the beginnings of a larger bear market and recession. It’s been fast and steep, and the rebound thus far has been just as sudden. If you blinked you may have even missed it. </p>
<p>So what kind of investor have you been over the last few months? Did you get scared and jump ship, or have you stayed the course and stuck to your long-term allocation? If you went to cash you would have missed the recent rebound, which is already up around 10% for U.S. stocks. That’s a solid return, and one any investor should be happy to achieve over an entire year. This one only took a couple weeks. Or did you get greedy last year, ditching those much hated emerging market stocks in favor of red hot domestic tech? Many investors did just that. Turns out EM has fared the best in this selloff, down less than half that of U.S. stocks since the September high.</p>
<p>This is all just textbook evidence as to why timing the market and <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/withstanding-market-cycle-avoid-emotional-decision-making/">succumbing to emotional investment decisions</a> can hurt portfolio returns. At the end of the day, the vast majority of investors will be more successful simply creating a proper long-term allocation and sticking to it. If anything, the current pullback is a great opportunity for rebalancing back to target weights. At the moment, this likely translates into buying more stocks. And why not? If you liked stocks when markets were at all-time highs in September, why wouldn’t you like them now when they’re on sale? </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Stock Market</h2>
<p>Global stocks resumed a downward slide in December, led by US equities. International stocks held up better for the month and the full fourth quarter, but were the worst performing asset class for the year. Investors sought safety in gold and bonds, with domestic and international fixed income up approximately 2% in December.</p>
<p>While declines are almost always unpleasant, the fourth quarter helped validate the benefits of <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/withstanding-market-cycle-avoid-emotional-decision-making/">remaining disciplined</a> and taking a longer-term view.</p>
<h2>Trade War Impact, Interest Rate Environment, and the State of the Economy</h2>
<p>Equity losses in October were attributed to increased rhetoric on trade with China and messaging from the Fed that short term interest rates would continue to rise. By December, however, there were signs of progress on trade and Fed Chairman Powell suggested rate hikes may slow in 2019. Stocks continued to fall anyway. This tells us the market is no longer reacting solely to daily headlines, but is instead attempting to weigh the odds of a meaningful slowdown in global economic growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/market-timing-vs-time-in-market/">Timing recessions</a> is extremely difficult, and generally futile. Most economic data points remain solid, though there are some red flags. In the US, unemployment hovers around all-time lows, profits are at all-time highs and growing, and inflation remains in check. The housing market remains soft in terms of volume, but prices continue to advance in most regions. The story abroad is even more mysterious, with sluggish growth in Europe and weakening conditions in China.</p>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>In the short-term, the sell-off feels overdone. For 2019 in general, our outlook is balanced. As usual, it isn’t a good time for letting fear or greed dictate approach. If anything, declines make stocks attractive than they were a few months ago. Valuations are now mixed. The forward PE of the S&#038;P 500 is at 15, which is compelling relative to still low interest rates. Other metrics such as price to sales or the value of the US market compared to GDP show stocks remaining expensive. International stocks are trading at lower valuations and are compelling on this basis. After years of US dominance, we believe a global approach is highly likely to be rewarded over the coming years.</p>
<p>Both market volatility and the New Year are great reasons to review your financial plan.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is part 3 of the “Withstanding Market Cycles” series on portfolio diversification and asset allocation…some of your best safeguards in times of volatility.</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1: <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/the-benefits-of-portfolio-diversification-withstanding-market-cycles/">The Benefits of Portfolio Diversification</a></li>
<li>Part 2: <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/how-to-determine-the-right-asset-mix-for-your-portfolio/">How to Determine the Right Asset Mix for Your Portfolio</a></li>
</ul>
<p></em></p>
<p>The tradeoff between risk and return is inescapable. Higher-risk, higher-volatility assets like stocks have historically produced better returns than lower-risk, lower-volatility assets like bonds. But there’s a price for that better return: you have to be able to handle that increased risk. There is no way to consistently enjoy that better return without accepting higher risk. </p>

<p>In the short-run, an investor who lowers their risk in a portfolio through diversification should not expect to see returns that match the best performing asset class over that same timeframe. This is a fundamental concept of investing, and it is unavoidable. </p>
<p>However, over a long enough time frame, a “reversion to the mean” happens – meaning the diversified approach often comes quite close to the performance of that high-risk asset class over longer timeframes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2019 is off to a wild start. Disappointing revenue guidance from Apple sparked fears around a general earnings slowdown, a harder than expected landing in China and recession in general. The mood swung quickly positive on Friday with a blowout jobs report and indications from Fed Chairman Powell that the central bank will be reactive to market conditions and is not on a “pre-set” path to higher rates. The dust settled with global stocks up modestly for the first few days of the year.  </p>
<h2>Weekly Returns</h2>
<p>S&#038;P 500: 2,532 (+1.9%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US (VEU): (+2.0%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.67% (-0.05)<br />
Gold: $1,285 (+0.4%)<br />
EUR/USD: $1.139 (-0.4%)</p>
<h2>Major Events</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monday – House Democrats said they would try to reopen government when they take control starting in 2019. Heading in to the weekend, the standoff continues.</li>
<li>Monday – Russia detained a US citizen for alleged spying, raising tensions.</li>
<li>Monday – Global equities posted modest gains but finished 2018 with the worst yearly returns since the financial crisis. </li>
<li>Wednesday – Tesla cut prices across its lineup by $2,000. Shares fell.</li>
<li>Thursday – Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to acquire Celgene for $74 billion.</li>
<li>Thursday – Nancy Pelosi was elected Speaker of the House. </li>
<li>Thursday – Apple said revenues would be lighter than expected, citing China as the primary source of weakness. Shares and markets overall fell. </li>
<li>Friday – The US added 312,000 jobs, well ahead of expectations, signaling the economy remains strong. Official unemployment ticked up to 3.9% as more people entered the labor force.</li>
<li>Friday – Fed Chairman Powell said policy is flexible, implying rates may not increase as quickly as previously indicated.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Stock prices continue to fluctuate wildly as investors try to assess the chances of recession arriving in 2019. Things seemed bleak on Thursday when a manufacturing number fell short of expectations and Apple announced its most serious revenue miss in years. All seemed forgotten by Friday as trade talk developments, a strong jobs report and dovish talk from the Fed combined to inspire buying. </p>
<p>Apple is of course a bellwether for the US market, and probably the favorite single stock of retail investors. But the real question was if Apple’s comments in China indicate a sharper than expected slowdown in the world’s second largest economy. It is difficult to tell if the issue lies with the company or the country. We would not be surprised if the trade conflict has tarnished the fashion status of owning an iPhone in China – either as a result of consumer views or direct government intervention. So it may be premature to draw a direct connection between one product and a $12 trillion economy. </p>
<p>Back home, a huge jobs report showed the US economy is still plowing forward. Jobs reports are more indicative of the present than the future, so all is not clear but the dour sentiment building early in the week seems to have been overblown.<br />
Over the last few weeks, schizophrenic markets have made trading the daily trends about the worst thing to do. Things aren’t all good, or all bad. It seems 2019 will not be dull. Happy New Year! </p>

<p>The markets had a volatile start to 2019, reminding us of the importance of a well-diversified portfolio. Determining the right asset mix is a crucial part of this process.</p>
<p><code><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ouYLVVzCGfg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></code></p>
<h2>Determining the Right Asset Mix for Your Portfolio</h2>
<p>The asset mix determines the level of risk in the portfolio, as well as the long-term return one can reasonably expect.</p>
<p>For example, If an individual has a long time horizon, is very tolerant of risk, and has a primary goal of aggressively growing these assets, then having a greater allocation toward a high-growth, high-risk asset class &#8211; like stocks &#8211; may make sense. But if an individual has a shorter time horizon, is relatively risk averse, and has a primary goal of asset preservation, then having a greater allocation toward a lower-growth, lower-risk asset class &#8211; like bonds &#8211; may make sense.</p>
<p>Combining multiple asset classes in one portfolio allows us to mitigate some of the losses associated with the capital markets. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we ring in the New Year, it’s time to consider <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/tips-max-out-your-401k/">boosting contributions</a> to your employer-sponsored retirement savings plan—and the federal government is willing to help (a little.) The maximum contribution has increased this year, so you can shelter a bit more money from taxation, if you choose, to maximize your retirement savings.</p>
<p>For most workers, the 401k is their standard employer-sponsored retirement plan. Some workers, however, are enrolled in 403b or 457b plans, instead. While there are some minor differences between these plans, they are generally treated in a similar manner, and they usually have the same maximum contribution limits. The main difference between these plans is worker classification. Generally, 401k plans are used by for-profit businesses; 403b plans are used by tax-exempt groups, such as schools or hospitals; and 457b plans are for government workers, although there are some non-governmental organizations that also qualify to use these plans.</p>
<p>For simplification purposes, this discussion will refer to the most common plan, the 401k. The information is still relevant, though, if you are enrolled in either a 403b or 457b plan.</p>
<h2>What Are The New Maximum Contributions?</h2>
<p>According to the IRS, If you are under age 50, your maximum 401k contribution is $19,000 in 2019, which is an increase of $500 over 2018 limits. For workers 50 and over, the catch-up contribution of $6,000 remains constant, which means you can contribute a total of $25,000 in 2019 if you are 50 or older. Matched contributions from your employer are not included in these limits. </p>
<p>If you are enrolled in a 403b and 457b plan, there are some minor differences in the “catchup provisions” in these plans. You should check with your plan administrator to learn about the specific provisions of your plan.</p>
<p>As you can see, investing in your 401k, 403b or 457b is a valuable, easy way to reduce your taxable income, while building your future retirement funds. <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/average-401k-balance-age/">With compounding, $19,000/year will add up over time!</a></p>
<h2>Do Those Numbers Sound Daunting?</h2>
<p>While it’s great that the new 2019 limits will allow workers to save hefty sums of tax-deferred money each year, there are many people who are more worried about saving anything at all or scraping together enough to capture their entire employer match. If that sounds more like you, it’s still a good time to take a fresh look at what you can contribute to an employer-sponsored retirement plan.</p>
<p>Some of the best advice you can embrace for your future financial self is to save as much as you can and start as soon as you can. Your employer-sponsored retirement plan is a natural starting point. It is particularly important to try to qualify for all matching contributions, which essentially creates an instant return on your investment.</p>
<p>If you have trouble saving, look for ways to decrease your monthly expenses and make saving a priority. If you’re not feeling the pinch at least a little each month, you could probably save more—and you probably should. Your retirement account will play a major role in the financial security of your future self. Saving now can help make that account turn into a worthy safety net and give you some financial peace of mind.</p>
<h2>Second 2019 Bonus For Savers: Recent Tax Changes</h2>
<p>If you have diligently saved money in a tax-deferred account, pat yourself on the back. The <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/taxes-insurance/2018-tax-strategies/">2018 tax reform bill</a> is giving you a little bonus—in addition to higher maximum contribution limits. Tax reform put many workers into a little bit of a lower tax bracket, which means the money you’ve already socked away escaped being taxed at the previously higher rates. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Readers – It has been an interesting close to 2018, to say the least. We have 1 more full trading day left in the year, and this may be the first year in recent memory where US stocks close out below where they started at the beginning of the year. Volatility has become much more common over the past several weeks, in stark contrast to relatively calmer past years. The S&#038;P 500, an Index many commonly review, nearly crossed the ‘Bear’ market threshold, but stopped short on the way down. </p>
<h2>Weekly Returns</h2>
<p>S&#038;P 500: 2,486 (2.8%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US(VEU): (1.0%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.72% (-2.58%)<br />
Gold: $1,223 (2.2%)<br />
EUR/USD: 1.144 (0.7%)</p>
<h2>Major Events</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monday – US markets react negatively to the government shutdown.</li>
<li>Monday – Oil futures hit an 18 month low.</li>
<li>Tuesday – Markets are closed for the Christmas Holiday.</li>
<li>Wednesday – US markets rebound, posting strong gains for the day.</li>
<li>Wednesday – President Trump makes his first visit to a combat zone to visit US troops.</li>
<li>Thursday – US markets again post positive returns after weeks of declines.</li>
<li>Friday – Wells Fargo announces another settlement related to its improper sales practices.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Even with one less trading day this week, the markets didn’t miss an opportunity to surprise investors. There was little ‘new’ news this week to point to what caused the volatility. It is reasonable to say that continued uncertainty around the ebbs and flows of trade escalation between China and the US, as well as fears around a Fed that continues to message a less accommodative stance are likely significant contributors. </p>
<p>Interestingly, and as we mentioned in a recent communication to our clients, there seems to have been a shift in investor sentiment. Prior to October of this year, many individuals I personally interacted with were bullish on the markets and interested in putting more of their capital in high flying performers like large cap technology stocks. Fast forward to now, and many investors have become more cautious, if not outright fearful, of the current market environment. </p>
<p>If one is a contrarian investor, where you assume that when most people think one thing, that the opposite will happen, a shift in sentiment from positive to negative could in fact be a good thing. Only time will tell.</p>
<p>We wish all our clients, users, and readers a safe, and happy transition into the New Year. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is part one of a series on portfolio diversification and asset allocation&#8230;some of the best safeguards against market volatility.</em></p>
<p>U.S. markets have taken a volatile turn in the last few months, recording one of the worst Decembers in recent years. Naturally, market fluctuations are met by a range of emotions from investors: fear, an instinct to get more conservative, or even panic. While market volatility can be a challenging time, the best safeguard you can have against market cycles is a well-diversified <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/take-emotion-out-of-investing-better-returns/">portfolio</a>.</p>
<h2>What is Diversification?</h2>
<p>Basically, a well-diversified portfolio is one that is not too heavily weighted in one area or another. Investors first diversify at a very high level by using different asset classes (equity, fixed income and alternatives). Next, they diversify within each asset class by <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/category/investing-markets/">investing</a> in different geographies, and then further by choosing different styles, sizes, and sectors.</p>
<p>Finally, investors attempt to diversify away from any risk involved with a specific company or investment by investing in a large number of companies by using pooled investments like mutual funds and ETF’s, or by purchasing a sufficiently large number of individual securities.</p>
<p>When an investor understands the different types of asset classes, sizes, styles and sectors, as well as their relationships to each other and the broader environment, they can construct their portfolios around their specific risk tolerance.</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Portfolio Diversification</h2>
<p>To wildly oversimplify: a well-diversified portfolio is less risky and volatile than being heavily weighted in one area, and should not impact overall positive performance. This video explains the benefits of a well-diversified portfolio, and discusses a diversified portfolio’s performance over different market cycles:</p>

<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Recent market volatility has given us a great “case study” about the importance of diversification. This month has seen very high highs and very low lows. The previously bullish FAANG tech stocks have been particularly hard hit, marking a change in the tide from earlier in the year. Keep in mind, though, it’s not unusual for recently successful asset classes to fall the fastest when markets decline. What comes up usually comes down. This is why diversification is so important – and a more diversified approach to U.S. stocks weathers the down days better. And of course, diversification at the asset class level helps even more.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to know what the future holds, but the bottom line is that remaining diversified and rebalancing are some of the best ways to ensure you’re in a good spot, regardless of what the market does and when.</p>

            <title>Avoid Emotional Decision Making During Market Volatility</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Recency Bias During Bull Markets</h2>
<p>New investors who have been in the market for nearly a decade may have never seen a bear market. Additionally, many of folks who were investing in the last bear seem to have forgotten what one is like. </p>
<p>This is a phenomenon known as recency bias: the belief that recent events or circumstances have always existed and will remain forever. According to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170301006175/en/New-DC-Pulse-Survey-BlackRock-Employees%E2%80%99-Retirement">BlackRock survey</a> of retirement plan participants, 66% of surveyed workers believe that over the next decade, returns on their savings will continue to be in line with what they have experienced in the past, while 17% believe they will experience even higher returns. This shows how this type of bias can be particularly dangerous during periods of rising markets because it can grow stronger as the market reaches higher peaks. For example, a lengthy bull market can lull us into a false sense of security, which can translate into trouble – how do you think asset bubbles are created?</p>
<p><code><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Kdh7BzBA5I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></code></p>
<h2>Recency Bias During Down Markets</h2>
<p>Recency bias works the opposite way, too, when you experience negative events. In 2008, the economy was teetering on the precipice and the stock market crashed. Many investors quickly determined that these negative events would continue, and they liquidated their investment portfolios. When the financial markets rebounded, many of those same investors realized their error and jumped back into the markets. Unfortunately, they locked in their losses and bought back in after much of the recovery had already happened, costing those investors dearly.</p>
<p>That sort of perspective can cause irrational fear during bear markets, and it can also produce undue optimism and confidence during bull markets.</p>
<h2>Avoiding Bias and Emotional Decision-Making</h2>
<p>The last few years have seemed easy, but that doesn’t mean we should simply expect that to continue. We’ve already seen the return of some serious market volatility in the second half of 2018, so avoiding knee-jerk reactions due to bias or fear is crucial. Meet with your financial advisor, ensure that your long-term plan accounts for your level of risk tolerance and that your portfolio is well-diversified, and stick to the plan.</p>
<p>When emotions or recency bias become dominant factors in our decision making, the results are usually poor. We get greedy after good times in the markets, and fearful after bad times.</p>
<p>Timing bull and bear markets consistently simply does not work, which is why institutional investors use <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/guide-portfolio-diversification/">diversification</a> as a core tenet of their investment strategies. </p>
<p>And if we get market timing even slightly wrong, it can be hugely damaging to long-term returns. </p>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>We are all susceptible to bias – such as following the herd and overconfidence in our own abilities. Utilizing a systematic, diversified investment strategy – and sticking to that long-term plan – is the best way to eliminate emotions and biases from our investments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If it was not already assumed, it has now been confirmed there will be NO Santa Rally this year with only one abbreviated trading day left to go before the holiday.  The market instead flaunted its ugly red Christmas sweater while the Fed took away the punchbowl.  The Nasdaq and international stocks officially entered bear market territory both dropping over the 20% threshold from their high, while the S&#038;P500 is nearing bear market territory and is down 7% just this week alone!  Investors rotated into the more defensive sectors of the market like utilities and continued to sell the risk-on areas like technology.  Global growth slowdown concerns are the underlying theme, but <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/whitepapers/investors-guide-to-volatile-markets/">volatility</a> picked up around the Federal Reserve’s rate hike decision and the uncertainty over a government shutdown looming with a deadline of midnight tonight.  Lawmakers are scrambling to try and avert a shutdown by passing a spending bill that must be approved by both the House and the Senate and signed by President Trump. If there is one thing markets do not like, it is uncertainty, which continues to put downward pressure on prices in 2018.     </p>
<h2>Weekly Returns</h2>
<p>S&#038;P 500: 2,417 (-7.05%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US (VEU): (-3.47%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.79% (-.10%)<br />
Gold: $1,256 (1.41%)<br />
EUR/USD: 1.136 (0.45%)</p>
<h2>Major Events</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monday – Criminal charges were filed against Goldman Sachs by Malaysian authorities over the 1MDB state investment fund, multibillion-dollar corruption scandal.</li>
<li>Tuesday – The sentencing of Michael Flynn for lying to the FBI about the Russian interference investigation was delayed unexpectedly.</li>
<li>Tuesday – The Trump Foundation announced plans to dissolve in the face of allegations over fund misuse.</li>
<li>Wednesday – The Fed raised the benchmark rate for a fourth time this year to 2.5% and signaled a raise to 3% over two hikes in 2019.</li>
<li>Thursday – U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis resigned after an announcement came out of Trump’s plan to withdrawal U.S. troops from Syria.</li>
<li>Thursday – The House passed a $5 Billion stopgap funding bill with a vote of 217 to 185, increasing the likelihood of a government shutdown with the Senate likely to reject it.</li>
<li>Friday – Without an agreement reached, the potential government shutdown loomed over stocks which had their worst week since 2011.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>From our perspective, the market is attempting to factor in the odds of a meaningful slowdown in global economic growth.  Recessions do not announce their pre-arrival, and they usually are not confirmed until we are well into one.  Still, most economic data points remain solid.  In the U.S., low unemployment, profits near all-time highs, and moderate inflation all point to a stable economy. </p>
<p>Be wary of the media’s intentional attention-grabbing headlines that cause worry and play on your emotions.  You have likely seen many this week trying to call the next recession and sensationalizing the term “bear market”.  Although this correction in U.S. stocks is nearing bear market territory, this is not the same thing as an economic recession.  To clarify, an economic recession is typically defined as two consecutive quarters of declines in quarterly real (inflation adjusted) gross domestic product (GDP).  The point is, you can have a market correction or even a bear market without an economic recession &#8212; they are not synonymous.  A bear market without a recession tends to be shallower in nature compared to a bear with a recession which tends to be more severe.  Per LPL Research and FactSet, the average drop in all bear markets going back to 1946 was 31%, with a recession was 37% and without a recession was 24%.  What is even more interesting is that it was a 50/50 split, seven bears without a recession and seven with a recession, out of the fourteen defined bear markets over this period.  </p>
<p>Both bear markets and economic recessions are inevitable and very hard to predict, so focus on what you can control and don’t get caught up in the sensationalism.  This appears to be a healthy correction that has let some of the air out of an inflated market after a long accommodative period.  Despite all the noise of the government shutdown, it is unlikely to have a material economic impact.  There will always be noise, but the best thing you can do for yourself is stay the course by sticking to your financial plan that gets you to your long-term goals.  </p>
<p>We wish you a safe and happy holiday from everyone at Personal Capital.  And to those of you that had bad beats in last week’s outlier of fantasy football scoring and are now battling out a 3rd place consolation matchup, good luck this weekend!  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to announce the release of our second annual Affluent Family Financial Support Survey. The survey of individuals in the U.S. with household investable assets of at least $500,000 examined how affluent parents balance the needs and expectations of their families with their ability to live comfortably in retirement and leave a legacy.</p>
<p>“Affluent parents are trying to best prepare for their children’s futures by financing higher education, helping them get their first jobs and tackling important money conversations,” said Michelle Brownstein CFP®, Vice President of Private Client Services at Personal Capital. “Fortunately, these individuals are starting to cut the purse strings on their adult children to prioritize their own retirement saving and spending.” </p>

https://www.personalcapital.com/assets/public/Personal-Capital-2018-Affluent-Family-Finances-Report.pdf/" target="_blank">Get a PDF Version of the Report</a></p>
<h2>The Cost of Raising Children: From Grade School to Graduation</h2>
<p>Affluent parents have a realistic idea of what it costs to raise and support a child in today’s America. The Department of Agriculture estimates the average cost of raising a child over their lifetime to be $233,610, and 65 percent of affluent families reported planning to spend $250,000 or more.</p>
<p>Overall, parents anticipate the cost of raising a child over the course of their lifetime, excluding inheritance, to be $711,000, on average. That’s more than three times the Department of Agriculture’s estimates for the average American. Parents in the Northeast anticipate this figure to be even higher at $996,000, versus parents in the Midwest, South and West, who expect to spend less at $667,000, $581,000 and $579,000, respectively. </p>
<p>Higher education is a priority for affluent families. Seven in 10 parents reported paying or planning to pay for their child’s college. When it comes to spending for K-12 education, only 36 percent of parents didn’t spend or don’t plan to spend anything to fund their child’s education.  </p>
<p>Affluent parents in the Northeast have spent or plan to spend significantly more on average for their child’s grade school education with $96,800 on average versus $57,400 and $64,200 in the Midwest and West, respectively. </p>
<h2>Cutting the Purse Strings: Expectations versus Reality</h2>
<p>Half of affluent parents reported that they stopped, or plan to stop, supporting their children following college graduation, but first, four in 10 (39 percent) of respondents said they plan to help or helped their child get his or her first post-graduate job. That number jumps for affluent millennial parents, who are significantly more likely (86 percent) to have helped or plan to help their child get their first post-graduate job.</p>
<p>Despite planning to stop supporting their children post-college, 71 percent of affluent parents believe their child expected or will expect them to pay for big ticket purchases including undergraduate school (54 percent), a car (42 percent) and a wedding (40 percent). In reality, parents report they’re planning to pay more. Respondents indicated that they have helped or will help their child pay for any or all of their undergraduate school (70 percent), a car (51 percent) and a wedding (68 percent), significantly more than what they believe their children expect.</p>
<p>Emphasizing the focus on planning and preparing for their own retirement, two-thirds (66 percent) would choose to spend their money on themselves in retirement versus passing on an inheritance to their child. What’s more, while only one in five (19 percent) affluent parents indicated they do not expect to have to change their retirement plans in order to support their children, 66 percent of affluent millennials anticipate they will need to make an adjustment.</p>
<p>When it comes to education specifically, over half (54 percent) of affluent parents put a priority on saving for their own retirement versus their child’s education. Again, millennial parents buck the trend as 64 percent prioritize their child’s college cost over their own retirement.</p>
<h2><Leaving a Legacy

Three quarters of affluent parents (71 percent) expect their children to be as wealthy or wealthier than themselves. To prepare their children for the future, 77 percent of affluent parents say they have talked to their kids about saving and investing. Other popular topics for discussion include earning and working hard (75 percent), budgeting and spending (70 percent), the family’s net worth (38 percent) and philanthropy and giving (36 percent). Perhaps that’s why most affluent parents (85 percent) do not consider their child a risk to their own financial wellness, such as being overly financial dependent on them or irresponsible with money.

Regarding their estates, almost all affluent parents (98 percent) plan to leave something for their children. Thirty-nine percent plan to leave assets to their grandchildren and 32 percent plan to leave something to charity.

Affluent parents use varying financial products to make their money work for them and to create a financial legacy for their children. Three in four (74 percent) are invested in the stock market. Most respondents use checking accounts (86 percent) and Roth IRAs/IRAs (76 percent). Although 72 percent of affluent adults have savings accounts, only 41 percent have a high-yield savings account.
“While Affluent Americans are spreading their wealth across several different investment vehicles, they are not necessarily managing their cash properly,” said Brownstein. “Every person, regardless of wealth, should have a savings account for emergencies, and ideally those should be high yield savings accounts so investors can earn on the cash they’re holding onto and achieve their long-term goals.”

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the time when many people make resolutions for the upcoming year. Determining to lose weight, eat healthier or exercise more are some of the most common New Year’s resolutions. But financially-related New Year’s resolutions also consistently made it into the top spots.</p>
<p>As 2019 approaches, you may be vowing to do better around your physical and financial health. If you fall into the latter camp, here are five ideas to get you started:</p>
<p><code><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I1KPzuEnOQo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></code></p>
<h2>Manage Your Debt Efficiently</h2>
<p>Excessive and irresponsible use of debt is one of the biggest hindrances to financial success for many people. Every dollar that goes toward paying down debt is a dollar that can’t be used for more productive financial goals like saving for retirement or college.</p>
<p>Start by prioritizing so you can focus on paying down debts with the highest interest rates first. For most people, this is credit card debt. If you carry balances on more than one card, focus on paying off one card at a time before moving on to the next one. When you’ve paid off all your credit card debt, move on to other consumer debts like car loans.</p>
<p>Your goal shouldn’t necessarily be to eliminate debt, but rather to manage your debt efficiently. When used responsibly, debt can be an effective financial tool — deductible home mortgage and home equity line of credit interest is a good example. You might consider restructuring some debt; for example, locking in fixed-rate debt for the long term before interest rates move higher.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software/net-worth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See a complete picture of your net worth at any time.</a></p>
<h2>Control Your Spending</h2>
<p>This goes along with managing your debt. Paying down debt won’t accomplish much if you don’t get a handle on spending — you’ll just find yourself right back where you were in a year or two.</p>
<p>Controlling spending is often a matter of learning the art of delayed gratification. Instead of using a credit card to buy things you want right now, wait until you’ve saved enough money and then buy them. Many people find that they enjoy their purchases more when they buy them this way because they don’t have the cloud of debt payments hanging over their head.</p>
<h2>Build a “Rainy Day” Savings Fund</h2>
<p>Many financial experts recommend accumulating between three and six month’s worth of living expenses in a liquid savings account you can tap for financial emergencies, like an unexpected car repair, major medical expense or job loss. A bank savings or money market account is usually a good vehicle since the money can typically be withdrawn penalty-free and without tax consequences.</p>
<p>When you have cash set aside for financial emergencies like these, you won’t have to use a credit card to pay for them. This, in turn, will help you as you concentrate on New Year’s resolution number 1 above.</p>
<h2>Increase Your Retirement Savings</h2>
<p>The latest statistics regarding <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/category/retirement-planning/">retirement </a>savings in the U.S. are pretty bleak. The median retirement account balance for all working-age households in the U.S. is just <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/23/how-much-us-families-have-in-retirement-savings-and-how-much-they-need.html">$5,000</a>. Also, nine out of 10 U.S. households do not meet conservative retirement savings targets for their age and income.</p>
<p>You can buck these statistical trends by resolving to max out your retirement savings accounts this year. In 2019, you can contribute up to $19,000 to a 401(k), 403(b) or 457 retirement plan, or $25,500 if you’re 50 years of age or over. In addition, you can contribute up to $6,000 to an IRA, or $7,000 if you’re 50 years of age or over.</p>

<h2>Evaluate Your Asset Allocation and Rebalance Your Portfolio</h2>
<p>Over time, the mix of asset classes in your investment portfolio can shift as the markets fluctuate. This will affect your <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/getting-ahead-of-the-curve-asset-allocation-2/">asset allocation</a> — or the percentage of your portfolio that consists of stocks, bonds and cash instruments. When this happens, it may be necessary to rebalance your portfolio.</p>
<p>You can do this by selling some asset classes, such as stocks, and buying others, such as fixed-income instruments. For example, with the stock market performing well over the past year, your portfolio might be over-weighted in equities. If so, you might consider selling some stocks and using the money to buy bonds in order to bring your portfolio back into balance to meet your long-term investing goals.</p>

<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>With the new year approaching quickly, now is a good time to plan your 2018 financial resolutions so you can hit the ground running on January 1.</p>
<p>Be sure to consult with a financial advisor for more details on these and other financial planning strategies.

					<p><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/category/legacy-estate-planning/">Estate planning</a> can be a heavy subject. We all know we have to do it, but thinking about our own mortality is not an easy thing. Our <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/whitepapers/guide-to-legacy-and-estate-planning/">“Guide to Legacy &amp; Estate Planning”</a> covers all of the gritty details – how to start with estate planning, when and how to update your estate plan, estate planning and tax considerations, charitable giving and your estate plan…and so much more.</p>
<p>But here’s something to ease you into it…5 off-the-wall estate planning facts you probably didn’t know:</p>

					<h2>1. The Slayer Rule</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-48964 alignright" src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1.png" alt="Felony murder excludes you as a beneficiary" width="144" height="144" /></p>
<p>A beneficiary of an estate is prohibited from their inheritance if the beneficiary committed murder. For example, a murderer cannot inherit from his or her parents if the he or she killed them.</p>
<h2>2. Firearms &amp; Your Estate</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-48965 alignleft" src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2.png" alt="firearms" width="144" height="144" /></p>
<p>The beneficiary for firearms in your estate must have a permit and possibly undergo a background check before receiving their inheritance. If your heirs live in another state, transferring firearms across state lines can violate laws, so make sure to do your research when designating a beneficiary.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>3. Endangered Animals</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-48966 alignright" src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3.png" alt="" width="144" height="144" /></p>
<p>Federal law bars possession or trafficking of an American bald eagle, even if it’s dead. If the eagle was acquired before 1940, the owner may pass it down to family members, but still cannot sell it.</p>
<h2>4. Scattering Remains</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-48967 alignleft" src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/4.png" alt="" width="144" height="144" /></p>
<p>Wanting to scatter your ashes in a remote Hawaiian Cove, a National Park, or a beloved vacation destination? Be aware that there are restrictions on where your ashes can be scattered! At Disney theme parks, there are so many instances of park guests spreading a loved one’s ashes on a ride or elsewhere in the park that Disney has a code word for staff: “white powder alert”. An attempt to do this will likely result in ejection from the park and a visit with the local police.</p>
<h2>5. Collectibles</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-48968 alignright" src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/5.png" alt="" width="144" height="144" /></p>
<p>There is a higher capital gains rate on selling collectibles. Instead of paying a <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/taxes-insurance/personal-capital-tax-series-7-the-capital-gains-tax/">capital gains</a> rate (the highest is 20%), you would pay your ordinary income tax rate with a cap of 28%. Retaining collectibles until date of death could afford a “step-up” basis, which could lessen or eliminate the capital gains tax when the collectibles are eventually sold by your heirs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Equities rallied early in the week when it appeared trade tensions were easing between the U.S. and China, but the party was short lived. A string of negative global economic data points sent markets lower, with the S&amp;P 500 approaching lows set earlier in the year after the February selloff. Amidst these rising concerns, U.S. investment grade corporate bonds were one of the few places to hide, ending the week in positive territory.</p>
<h2>Weekly Returns</h2>
<p>S&#038;P 500: 2,600 (-1.3%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US (VEU): (-0.5%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.89% (+0.04%)<br />
Gold: $1,238 (-0.9%)<br />
USD/EUR: $1.131 (-0.8%)</p>
<h2>Major Events</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monday – Facing mounting opposition, British Prime Minister Theresa May delayed a parliamentary vote on Brexit.</li>
<li>Monday – Apple was banned from selling older iPhones in China due to patent infringement against Qualcomm.</li>
<li>Tuesday – China announced it will reduce tariffs on U.S. automobiles from 40% to 15%.</li>
<li>Tuesday – Google CEO Sundar Pichai faced questions before the House Judiciary Committee on data privacy and political biases.</li>
<li>Wednesday – President Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to multiple felony counts.</li>
<li>Thursday – The ECB confirmed its plans to end new bond buying in December, while simultaneously cutting its outlook for economic growth.</li>
<li>Friday – Chinese industrial production and retail sales both came in lower than expected.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>After a period of seemingly all negative news, there was some softening in the U.S. and China’s trade dispute earlier in the week. It began when China stated they would reduce tariffs on U.S. automobiles, and gained steam on reports they are redrafting their controversial “Made in China 2025” policy. These developments are certainly a step in the right direction, and markets were up following the news. That said, gains were modest, and in the end global equities finished the week down. </p>
<p>Part of this is because it’s still unclear whether these concessions are the beginning of more substantial changes to come, or whether their only purpose is to delay negotiations on more critical issues. After all, they fail to address the elephant in the room, which is better IP protection and forced technology transfers.</p>
<p>But another reason these gains proved fleeting is concern around slowing global growth. There were a handful of relatively negative economic data points this week, including softer U.S. housing, a reduced growth forecast from the ECB, and weaker than expected industrial production and retail sales out of China. </p>
<p>To be sure, these data points are often volatile and will fluctuate week to week. And when it comes to the U.S., both corporate earnings and employment remain strong. So it’s too early to draw any concrete conclusions about future growth. But some of these areas are worth monitoring. In particular, housing and employment tend to be good indicators of economic health. Any material falloff in these metrics could potentially signal more volatility to come. </p>

					<p>This question comes up frequently when it comes to <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/category/retirement-planning/">retirement</a>:  can I contribute to a 401k and an IRA? Fortunately for your <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/nest-egg-consolidated-investment-strategy/">retirement nest egg</a>, you can contribute to both types of retirement accounts. In fact, both workplace and individual retirement accounts represent important building blocks in building your retirement savings. Supplementing your workplace retirement account is a great way to boost your retirement savings and put even more of your money to work in tax-advantaged accounts.</p>
<p>An added bonus: IRAs also often offer more investment options than the typical 401k plan. Just as with your traditional 401k, you may contribute pretax dollars to a <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/traditional-iras-retirement-tax-savings/">traditional IRA</a> (as I discuss further, you can only contribute pretax dollars up to certain income levels) and then benefit from tax-deferred growth and distributions.</p>
<h2>Contribution Limits For A 401k And An IRA</h2>
<p>While contributing to both a 401k and IRA is certainly allowed, there are a few considerations to keep in mind. The first is the contribution limits the IRS places on each type of account, which are outlined in the table below.</p>

					<p>* The IRA contribution limit does not apply to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/rollovers-of-retirement-plan-and-ira-distributions">Rollover</a> contributions</li>
<li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a/index.html">Qualified reservist repayments</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that contribution limits apply to the total of your contributions to all of your retirement accounts, either IRA or 401k. Note that the chart above includes the Roth option – which has been available for 401ks and IRAs since 2006.</p>
<p>Paying attention to these limits is important. If you do contribute more to your IRA accounts than is allowed (this frequently happens for individuals making Roth contributions), you’ll face a penalty in the form of a 6% tax on the excess contributions for each year they remain in the account.</p>
<p>Putting too much into a 401k happens from time to time, especially for those that change jobs throughout the year but is rare to occur if you were fully employed at only one company for all twelve months, as most plan administrators won’t allow it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, if either of the situations occur, you have until April 15th of the following year to remove the excess funds.</p>
<p>If you miss that deadline, you should work with a CPA to calculate any tax liability.</p>

<h2>IRA Deduction Limits</h2>
<p>If you save with both a 401k and a traditional IRA, you may also face some limits on your ability to deduct your contributions depending on your income. Contributions to a Roth are never deductible.</p>
<p>For instance, if you are covered by a retirement plan at work:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can deduct up to the contribution limit, if you’re single and your modified AGI is $64,000 or less for 2019. This is up from $63,000 in 2018. You can take a partial deduction if your income is between $64,000 and $74,000 in 2019 (between $63,000 and $73,000 in 2018). There’s no deduction for people who earn more than $74,000 in 2019 ($73,000 in 2018).</li>
<li>If you’re married and filing jointly, you can deduct the full amount if your modified AGI is $103,000 or less in 2019 (up from $101,000 in 2018). You can take a partial deduction if your income is between $103,000 and $123,000 in 2019 (between $101,000 and $121,000 in 2018). There’s no deduction if you earn more than $123,000 in 2019 ($121,000 in 2018).</li>
</ul>
<p>Deducting your contributions is always an added bonus, but keep in mind even that if you’re above the limit to make a contribution and reduce your taxes, there are alternative and potentially better strategies to explore than the nondeductible Traditional IRA.</p>
<h2>Examples Of How You Can Contribute To Both A 401k And An IRA</h2>
<p>Let’s look at an example of how you can combine the power of the 401ks and IRAs to speed up your retirement savings:</p>
<p><strong>Example #1:</strong> Consider a 30-year-old earning $55,000 per year (22% federal marginal tax bracket). Her first priority should be saving at least enough in her workplace retirement plan to earn the full employer match, which in her case is 50% of the first 6% saved (a typical match scenario).</p>
<p>In this case, she’s saving nearly $5,000 in tax-deferred funds in her 401k ($3,300 + $1,650 match). However, perhaps she’s anticipating earning far more in the near future and wants to sock away some after-tax money while she’s still in a relatively low tax bracket. She could save an additional $6,000 in a Roth IRA. That brings her total annual contributions to $10,500, all of it growing in tax-advantaged accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Example #2:</strong> Finally, consider a married 55-year-old woman earning $300,000 per year. Say she’s maxing out her workplace 401k at her $19,000 yearly contribution limit. Because she’s over 50, she also gets to make a catch-up contribution of $6,000 to her 401k. Luckily, her work matches contributions one-for-one up to 6% of her salary – which means another $18,000 in her 401k, for a total of $43,000 that is pre-tax and will grow tax-free.</p>
<p>While she can also contribute $6,500 to a traditional IRA, her contributions will be nondeductible given her modified AGI level. The savings will still grow tax-free, so she decides it’s still a worthwhile retirement savings vehicle to pursue, despite the fact that it’s tied up for the next 4.5 years.*</p>

<p>Based on the above chart, you can see how <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/average-401k-balance-age/">401k savings can really start adding up over time</a>. The low end assumes a consistent maximum contribution at the 2019 limit of $19,000 after the first year contribution of $8,000 with zero company match and zero growth. The high end column assumes a consistent maximum contribution of $19,000 plus an 8.0% annual rate of return with zero company match.</p>

<h2>Why Socially Responsible Investing Matters</h2>
<p>As Director of Portfolio Implementation at Personal Capital, Brendan Erne plays a critical role in constructing and managing investment portfolios, as well as building our broader research team. He has also been instrumental in implementing our Socially Responsible Personal Strategy, Personal Capital’s holistic approach to socially responsible investing. Following is an FAQ on all things Socially Responsible Investing and why it is important to Personal Capital clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gEBpKtMoxA0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></code></p>
<h2>Define Socially Responsible Investing</h2>
<p>“Socially responsible” is still a very broad and subjective concept. What one investor deems socially responsible is often completely different from another. Up until recently, it has mostly fallen on each investor to decide what companies, industries or sectors they should exclude from their portfolio – with the goal of aligning their investments with their personal beliefs.</p>
<p>So, if someone didn’t want exposure to tobacco or gun producers, they&#8217;d simply exclude them from being purchased in their portfolio. This form of “exclusionary” investing is referred to in the industry as “S.R.I.,” and is the most common form of socially responsible investing being used today.</p>
<p>And while excluding specific categories can be effective, a newer and much more robust form of socially responsible investing is gaining momentum. This methodology is referred to as <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/how-esg-ratings-agencies-work/">ESG</a> (Environmental, Social and Governance). It is through these high-level categories that a company’s “social responsibility” is assessed. The “E” covers areas such as carbon emissions and renewable energy projects, the “S” includes policies like employee diversity and safe work conditions, while the “G” encompasses issues like board independence and executive compensation.</p>
<p>While there is no global standard on how to evaluate these metrics, a handful of third-party firms have established thorough research and ranking methodologies. By using these ratings, investors can go much further in their application of socially responsible investing. Instead of simply excluding companies they don’t want to own, they can actively seek out companies doing a better job managing environmental, social and governance issues.</p>

<h2>Why Did Personal Capital Decide to Offer a Socially Responsible Strategy?</h2>
<p>This is really the combination of a few different factors, the first being the growing demand from our clients and prospects. Over the last few years, we’ve received an increasing number of requests for some sort of socially responsible offering. We wanted to be able to meet this need.</p>
<p>The second, and perhaps the most important reason, is it just feels right. It’s a natural adaptation to the world we live in. Whether it’s increasing awareness of the environment, disparities in the workplace or other socially conscious issues, there is a growing sense of urgency to do better by the planet and by each other. It seems only fitting we’d want to apply this mindset to investing.</p>
<p>The last reason is we saw an opportunity to produce something truly unique. There just aren’t a lot of socially responsible offerings in the market right now, and most of the ones available suffer from material shortcomings. There was a gap that simply wasn’t being addressed through traditional channels.</p>
<h2>How Do You Build These Types Of Portfolios? What Makes Them Different From Your Core Strategies?</h2>
<p>The biggest difference between this strategy and our core strategies is the U.S. equity component of the portfolio. Here, we partnered with independent research firm Sustainalytics for their ESG scores and ratings, and built a “best in class” portfolio of individual stocks. This means, on average, companies selected have an overall ESG ranking in the 90th percentile relative to their domestic peer groups. This is far higher than most other ESG funds and ETFs available in the market.</p>
<p>We also removed the energy sector due to its heavy concentration in fossil fuels and filtered out companies with material exposure to adult entertainment, gambling, tobacco, controversial weapons, weapons-related military contracting and small arms.</p>
<p>The rest of the portfolio is built with a diversified mix of more traditional ETFs. This is primarily due to the fact that the industry is so new, and there just aren’t a lot of “ESG-optimized” ETFs with attractive pricing or sufficient liquidity. We do, however, continually monitor what’s available, and fully expect to add some of these funds once they gain a bit more traction.</p>
<p>Overall, the best part of our Socially Responsible Personal Strategy is it retains almost all of the same benefits as our core strategies. We still apply our Smart Weighting methodology, which more evenly weights the factors of size, style and sector. It maintains exposure to all six major liquid asset classes. It’s customizable and data-driven, based on individual financial goals and retirement objectives. And we still take a disciplined approach to rebalancing and tax management.</p>
<h2>What Should Investors Expect In Terms of Return Compared to Core Portfolios?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/how-does-sri-impact-potfolio/">Performance is probably the most common concern for someone considering a socially responsible investment portfolio.</a> And there have actually been numerous studies going back in time attempting to quantify the impact. At this point it is still inconclusive whether socially responsible investing can generate any outperformance, but most studies indicate it can at least match performance of the broader market.</p>
<p>Moreover, a recent study from MSCI (Foundations of ESG Investing, Part 1: How ESG Affects Equity Valuation, Risk and Performance) produced some interesting results around companies with higher ESG rankings. It found that higher ranked companies tended to be more profitable and paid higher dividends, showed lower incidents of large stock drawdowns, and exhibited less earnings volatility and less systemic volatility.</p>
<p>We also conducted an internal back test to determine the impact of removing the energy sector. Over the period tested (1990 to 2017), it actually produced a slightly higher return coupled with a slightly higher standard deviation. So, at the end of the day, I’d say we don’t expect any material performance deviations from our core portfolios over full market cycles. We just might see a tad more volatility given the more concentrated investment universe after removing energy.</p>
<h2>How is your socially responsible strategy different from others in the marketplace?</h2>
<p>This is where I think we truly shine. As I said earlier, we take a best in class approach to finding socially responsible companies. On average, they rate above the 90th percentile in their domestic peer groups. As a comparison, one of the most widely used “ESG optimized” ETFs is DSI, a fund from iShares. If you applied the same ranking methodology, the fund’s average ESG percentile would only fall in the mid to high 70s. That’s a pretty big difference.</p>
<p>We also incorporate our Smart Weighting methodology to prevent unwanted sector, size and style skews. Many existing socially responsible offerings can have more than a third of their portfolio in a single sector. DSI, for example, is more than 30 percent technology stocks. That’s a huge bet to have on one sector.</p>
<p>Our use of individual stocks also allows for more precise target weights, as well as more granular opportunities for tax loss harvesting. Moreover, it means the portfolio remains fully customizable. If a client doesn’t like a specific company or industry, they can simply restrict it. You can’t do this with a fund or ETF.</p>
<p>The last point is one I mentioned earlier. Our Socially Responsible Personal Strategy comes with all the same benefits as our core strategies. It’s still dynamic and data-driven, based on each individual’s unique financial situation and goals. It simply does all this while also applying a socially responsible filter to the portfolio.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Initial post G-20 optimism on trade with China faded and stocks fell for the week. The arrest of Chinese telecom giant Huawei’s CFO in Canada over alleged Iran sanctions violations threatened to escalate tensions. Meanwhile, Friday’s jobs report showed the United States added fewer new jobs than expected. Some investors viewed the report favorably, believing it was strong enough to show the economy is still growing but soft enough to allow the Fed to slow interest rate hikes. Others viewed it as a sign growth has peaked. Bonds gained.    </p>
<h2>Weekly Returns</h2>
<p>S&#038;P 500: 2,633 (-4.6%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US (VEU): (-3.1%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.85% (-0.16)<br />
Gold: $1,249 (+2.1%)<br />
EUR/USD: $1.14 (+0.8%)</p>
<h2>Major Events</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monday – President Trump named Robert Lighthizer, viewed as a China hard-liner, to lead trade negotiations. </li>
<li>Tuesday – Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States would withdraw from a nuclear treaty unless Russia took steps to be compliant within 60 days. </li>
<li>Wednesday – U.S. equity markets were closed to honor former president George H.W. Bush. </li>
<li>Thursday – Canada arrested Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in a U.S. request for extradition, complicating trade negotiations with China.</li>
<li>Thursday – Lyft was reported to have filed confidential paperwork in preparation for a potential IPO early next year. </li>
<li>Friday – The United States added 155,000 jobs, which was below expectations, as was wage growth. Official unemployment remained at 3.7%, the lowest since 1969. </li>
<li>Friday &#8211; OPEC and partners agreed to cut 1.2 million barrels of oil production per day, which was larger than expected. Oil prices rose but remain sharply lower over the past month.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>There is a long list of reasons to be fearful of stocks right now – trade, inverted yield curve, Brexit, jobs, slowing housing market, loss of momentum in tech stocks, and negative returns for global stocks. None of that helps anyone know where stock prices are going next. It can be better to buy when risk feels high than when skies are blue.</p>
<p>Global stocks are down almost 10% so far in the fourth quarter. In this same period, U.S. bonds are up about 1%. Overall, 2018 has been a rough year for bonds. The U.S. Aggregate bond market remains down about 1%. That isn’t going to derail an investment portfolio, but no one buys bonds to lose money. It isn’t common. According to Ibbotson, intermediate term U.S government bonds have only been negative in about 10% of years since 1926. There have only been two years when both U.S. bonds and U.S. stocks finished in the red, which is a real possibility right now for 2018. </p>
<p>We urge investors not to let emotion or recent performance dictate allocations when it comes to stocks or bonds. Stocks have been wonderful at generating wealth over time. We expect they will continue to be so. They’ve also had some big down moves, and that won’t change either. Bonds are more stable.<br />
What has become under-appreciated about bonds is their low or negative correlation to stocks. If you knew stocks were going to go up, you wouldn’t need to own bonds. But when stocks go down, it can feel great to have something in your portfolio going up, even if only moderately. For some, a nearly 100% allocation to stocks is appropriate. For others, that number is much lower. For most, bonds should make up most of the balance. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In November, equity markets recouped some of the losses from October. Headline returns for the month understate choppiness along the way. Steep losses in select high-momentum tech stocks indicate that long-standing trends are being tested. Increased sector diversification, relative to capitalization weighted indices like the S&amp;P 500, has been valuable during recent down moves, and we believe it will continue to be important.</p>
<h2>Trade Conflict &amp; Central Bank Policy Provide Cause For Optimism</h2>
<p>Focus remained on trade conflict and central bank policy, and both topics provided cause for optimism. Fed Chairman Powell said that rates are “just below” neutral, in contrast to an earlier statement that described them as “a long way” from neutral. A December rate hike remains widely expected, but expectations have shifted to only one 0.25% hike for 2019 as opposed to two or three at the start of November. As a result, bonds gained in November, but the US Aggregate Bond market remains down about 2% for the year.</p>
<h2>Impact of Trade Conflict With China Remains Unknown</h2>
<p>Hopes for a thaw in the trade conflict with China grew. After a widely anticipated meeting between the presidents of the two nations at the G-20 summit in Argentina, a cease-fire of sorts was announced. Stocks initially rallied, then quickly retreated. The path ahead remains unclear. Relations with China, of which trade is just one piece, will be a long and complicated road. In the short term, global equity markets will continue to react to new developments with the understanding that further breakdown in trade with China would create a significant headwind for global economic growth.</p>
<h2>S&amp;P Earnings Grow; Apple Stumbles</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, S&amp;P 500 earnings grew over 25% in Q3, making stocks more attractive on a valuation basis. While some estimates claim about half of that growth was attributed to tax cuts, companies continue to innovate and grow. While the results were exceptional, they appear to have been widely expected, as strong results were often rewarded lightly while misses were punished more significantly.</p>
<p>Apple, often viewed as a symbol of this bull market, experienced a rare stumble in November. Numerous reports suggesting lower iPhone demand trickled in, sending shares down 18% for the month. We don’t have a specific forecast for Apple, but we’re reminded how tough it is to be at the top and that no company should be considered risk-free.</p>
<p>After a relatively quiet few months, Bitcoin fell 36% and dropped below $4,000. We continue to avoid speculative trends and focus on helping our clients achieve personalized long-term retirement goals by diversifying within core asset classes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a id="trackExitButton" class="marketing-link-large" href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/whitepapers/guide-to-end-of-year-tax-planning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read the Guide.</a></p>
<h2>Does The State Of The Economy Impact How You Approach Your Financial Planning Strategy?</h2>
<p>It’s a fair question, especially as we’ve seen the return of <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/market-volatility-how-will-you-react/">volatility</a> in the latter half of the year. There’s no telling where the market will go in the New Year, but the key to financial success in the long-term is having a set allocation and the discipline to stick to it regardless of the economic environment.</p>
<p>Too many investors tend to let the market drive their investment decisions, a factor that causes them to lose focus and discipline. Often, greed causes investors in up markets to hold onto positions that have done well rather than taking profits. And in down markets, fear causes some to run away from areas that are hit hardest, rather than buy into the areas that are most attractively priced. When the markets are flat or stable, investors often get bored or trade for the sake of trading, without rhyme or reason.</p>
<h2>Avoid Market Timing In Favor Of Disciplined Rebalancing</h2>
<p>That’s why it’s imperative to stick with your plan. By following a consistent plan, you force yourself in a non-emotional way to buy lower and sell higher. Market timing does not work, but rebalancing does. Having the discipline to rebalance in a targeted and consistent way can help you avoid letting emotions—namely fear and greed—run the show.</p>
<p>Having financial discipline and being focused on a strategy that includes rebalancing will provide consistency in how you approach different economic environments. Having a framework for how decisions should be made will help you navigate different environments and will allow for better long-term thinking.</p>
<h2>How Do You Build Financial Discipline?</h2>
<p>The best way to build discipline is to establish a holistic financial plan, including short, medium, and long-term goals. Having the right allocation for each goal so that you are taking the appropriate amount of risk and return is critical. Seeking the advice of a financial advisor is a good way to get feedback and suggestions as you make decisions.</p>
<h2>7 Steps to Take in 2019</h2>
<p>To help you get started on your disciplined approach to financial freedom in 2019 and beyond, here are seven steps to take:</p>
<h3>Step 1 &#8211; Know Where You Are</h3>
<p>This means making a list of all of your assets and debts, as well as a list of your monthly income and expenses. A tool like <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software">Personal Capital’s dashboard</a> can help you determine your financial standing.</p>
<h3>Step 2 &#8211; Put Goals In Place</h3>
<p>Do you want to <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/whitepapers/home-buying-guide-intro/">buy a house</a>? Save for <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/category/retirement-planning/">retirement</a>? Pay off debt? Whatever your plan, write it down. Rid yourself of bad debt and create an emergency savings account for a rainy day. A good rule of thumb is to save three to six months of expenses in a high yield savings account so it’s fully liquid in the event of an emergency, but not something you rely on for your day-to-day expenses.</p>
<h3>Step 3 &#8211; Calculate How Much You Need</h3>
<p>Figure out how much money you need to save each month to reach your long-term goals. Tools like the <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software/retirement-planner">Personal Capital Retirement Planner</a> can help with this calculation.</p>
<h3>Step 4 &#8211; Set A Budget For Monthly Expenses And Savings</h3>
<p>You should not only calculate these numbers, but also stick to the budget. Try setting up an auto-deposit from your checking account into an investment account (consider a <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/tips-max-out-your-401k/">401K</a>, IRA or Roth IRA). The auto deposit will force savings so you don’t have to think about it. Seek small ways to save money that will eventually add up — bring your lunch instead of eating out, make coffee at home, etc.</p>
<h3>Step 5 &#8211; Create An Investment Strategy (And Stick With It)</h3>
<p>Talk is cheap, so do more than talk. If you’re unsure of what allocations to make, <a href="http://personalcapital.com/wealth-management">set up a meeting</a> with an advisor to help you come up with a long-term, <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/diversification-is-key-to-weathering-market-volatility/">well-diversified</a> investment strategy that will best suit your risk tolerance and your goals.</p>
<h3>Step 6 &#8211; Monitor Your Budget Weekly And Monthly</h3>
<p>Tracking your target spending is critical. As you get comfortable sticking to the weekly targets, you may be able to check in only once per month.</p>
<h3>Step 7 &#8211; Check And Recheck</h3>
<p>Rebalance your investment portfolio to your target allocation at least once per quarter.</p>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>The most sound strategies are the ones you create and adhere to relentlessly. Have a good plan and stick to it. While that may sound overly simplistic, the best plans are not overly complicated and if you’re in an investment allocation, you are comfortable with sticking to it in good times and bad, should not be difficult.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[On Friday, Marriott announced that the guest reservation database for it&#8217;s Starwood Hotels (which includes the Westin and St. Regis hotel chains) had suffered a massive data breach, affecting the records of an estimated 500 million U.S. customers going back to 2014. The scale of this most recent data breach is almost unprecedented, with only [&#8230;]]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday, Marriott announced that the guest reservation database for it&#8217;s Starwood Hotels (which includes the Westin and St. Regis hotel chains) <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2018/11/30/marriott-breach-what-happened-how-serious-is-it-and-who-is-impacted/#3b9da1477d25">had suffered a massive data breach</a>, affecting the records of an estimated 500 million U.S. customers going back to 2014.  The scale of this most recent data breach is almost unprecedented, with only Yahoo’s 2013 breach surpassing it at 3 billion affected. Compare this to the largest recent breaches such as the <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/market-news/equifax-breach-affects-me/">Equifax data breach</a> from last year (which affected 143 million consumers), and the Under Armor MyFitnessPal breach, affecting 150 million users.</p>
<h2>What Happened At Marriott And How Does It Affect Me?</h2>
<p>Of the announced 500 million leaked customer data files, 327 million had sensitive information compromised including names, mailing addresses, birthdates, passport information, email address and phone numbers. This is all a dream come true for identity thieves.</p>
<p>While many will call out that credit card information was obtained by criminals from the Marriott breach, consumers are largely shielded from risk due to the limited liability they have from diligently reported fraudulent transactions. The real danger is the other personal information that was compromised. </p>
<p>It seems that “Starwood Preferred Guest” did not apply a core principle of sound security: “assuming a state of compromise”. Security teams should operate defenses in a way that assumes security incidents will happen, and while not neglecting prevention, ensure that proper detection and response strategies are also in place.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it is time for individuals to also assume “a state of compromise” and apply a personal protection strategy that assumes criminals are likely to have very detailed files on you. Due to the number of breaches that have occurred with major corporations over the last few years, it’s fairly safe to assume that at least some of your personal information is no longer completely private.</p>
<h2>Immediate Steps To Protect Yourself From Data Breaches</h2>
<p>Whether you have or have not been affected by the Marriott data breach (or any other one), here are some of the things you can do right now to help mitigate the risks associated with these types of events.  </p>
<h3>Monitor Everything, Monitor Often</h3>
<p>Defending yourself against hackers requires you to quickly identify anything suspicious happening with your accounts or your identity:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sometimes, logging into your many different banking and credit card accounts can be dangerous.</strong> Fraudsters can gain access to your information by hacking into public WiFi or creating fake wireless networks in places like cafes or airports. This is where it becomes useful to have one place to monitor all of your accounts. Your Personal Capital dashboard allows you to monitor transactions across all accounts very easily and securely. If you detect something fraudulent, promptly report to the card company and you should have very little consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Use a credit monitoring service</strong> (we like <a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/">Credit Karma</a> – and it’s free!) to monitor new accounts that may be opened under your name. Again, report promptly if you notice anything unusual. While Marriott (and every breached company) offers you a service for this, our take is that the multiplication of your sensitive data across all of these different services may actually create more opportunities for it to be stolen. Pick a service you like and stick with it.</li>
<li><strong>You are entitled to a free copy of your credit report yearly, so take advantage of this and review it thoroughly.</strong> Put a yearly reminder on your calendar so that you can consistently monitor your credit report.</li>
<li><strong>Be on the lookout for phishing related to this data breach.</strong> Every time there is a large and well-publicized security event, criminals will try to leverage public knowledge of this to phish individuals. Don’t click on anything claiming to be from Marriott or Starwood Preferred Guest, however dramatic it may read. Call instead.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Lock Down Your Digital Identity</h3>
<p>If you are concerned that your data may be compromised and that you may be at risk for <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/family-life/the-financial-cost-of-identity-theft/">identity theft</a>, here are some steps you can take. Again, it&#8217;s generally best for people to assume their data has been compromised in some way given the rampant nature of digital fraud &#8212; so these tips are worth considering even if you don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ve been affected by a recent breach:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Freeze your credit file</strong> – Reach out to credit agencies (<a href="https://www.equifax.com/personal/?/">Equifax</a>, <a href="https://www.transunion.com/ppc-credit-report.page?&#038;channel=paid&#038;cid=ppc:GOOGLE:c:TU_B_MS_Core_Exact:transuinion:cid1&#038;kwid=43700005562521684&#038;opti_ca=166307821&#038;opti_ag=12095802781&#038;opti_ad=176432706601&#038;opti_key=kwd-90778192&#038;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3eSGhcCW1gIVCyhpCh1xlw-iEAAYASAAEgJ7__D_BwE&#038;gclsrc=aw.ds&#038;dclid=CL7C5YbAltYCFRRnfgodL9gMHA">Transunion</a>, <a href="https://www.experian.com/lp/exp-cred-itp-2.html?bcd=ad_c_sem_427_205114532611&#038;k_id=bc3d0c3b-3cfb-4586-8e37-01007086d710&#038;k_kw=kwd-12618301&#038;k_mt=e&#038;pc=sem_exp_google&#038;cc=sem_exp_google_ad_27946959_915476739_205114532611_kwd-12618301_e_1t1_bc3d0c3b-3cfb-4586-8e37-01007086d710&#038;ref=headterm&#038;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIur65i8CW1gIVRJF-Ch16WwNIEAAYASAAEgJXAfD_BwE">Experian</a> and <a href="https://www.innovis.com/">Innovis</a>) and request that your file be put on a “security freeze” (not a lock).  This is one of the most effective options for preventing identity theft since it will prevent anyone from opening new accounts in your name (including yourself). This option is generally not widely publicized since the industry wants you to open more accounts. Should you need to open new credit accounts for your own benefit, you would need to unfreeze and refreeze your accounts. In some cases, unfreezing may take some time, so plan ahead if you are planning for a new car, house or credit card. <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/free-credit-freezes-are-here">Since last September</a>, this is now free.</li>
<li><strong>Plant Your Flag</strong> – Initially coined by security reporter <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/06/plant-your-flag-mark-your-territory/">Brian Krebs</a>, this strategy involves making sure that you’ve “claimed” all your critical online accounts. Some folks, especially older people, avoid online accounts for their financial and banking services under the assumption that what’s not online can’t be hacked. Unfortunately, however, accounts that remain “unclaimed” online are easy targets for a cybercriminal who may have access to your sensitive personal information. Registering for an online banking account or an account with other government agencies is easy with a social security number, date of birth, name and mailing address. If you have already registered, they can’t claim your accounts. Make sure you have claimed and created passwords for at least the following services: Internal Revenue Service, Social Security Administration, the U.S. Postal Service, and your primary bank.</li>
<li><strong>Password Like A Pro</strong> &#8211; Most people will advise you to “not reuse passwords” or “use super-complicated passwords” in the wake of such an event. While this is not bad advice, it usually falls short on the how to make this practical. Here’s how to effectively change how you manage your passwords:
<ul>
<li>Get a password manager tool (see <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5529133/five-best-password-managers">Lifehacker’s reviews</a> for insight).</li>
<li>Secure your password manager with a long passphrase that you will not forget. “Matt likes to dance in the rain” is better than “5ue@1s21%.”</li>
<li>Once this is implemented, change your passwords to long passwords and unique ones that will be stored in your password manager (start with your Marriott password and anywhere else you may have used it).</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Global equity markets officially entered correction territory over last 2+ months, dropping over 10% from previous highs in September through October with significant volatility through November. This week markets began to rebound again, finishing both the week and the month in positive territory. Uncertainty remains a theme, highlighted by surprisingly dovish sentiment from the Federal Reserve given their recent comments, continuing trade discussions and the G20 Summit as well as the usual political mudslinging from both sides of the aisle.</p>
<h2>Major Events</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monday – U.S. Stocks climb higher, led by retailers, including Amazon as well as brick and mortar companies like Target, Macy’s and Kohls.</li>
<li>Monday – Crude Oil began to rebound after the largest one week decline since January of 2016 related to concerns of oversupply.</li>
<li>Tuesday – President Trump threatens to cut subsidies to GM after they released plans to end production at plants in Michigan and Ohio.</li>
<li>Tuesday – U.S. Markets continued to climb after optimistic comments about progress in trade talks with China at the G20 from Larry Kudlow, Director of the National Economic Council.</li>
<li>Wednesday – Federal Reserve Chairmen Jerome Powell announced that he believed interest rates were “just below” neutral rates, leading investors to believe that the pace and duration of rate raises in the U.S. might slow going forward.</li>
<li>Thursday – Trade tensions between U.S. and China appeared to ease as Washington announced that it would hold off on implementing further tariffs and plans for Presidents Trump and Xi to meet during the G20 Summit.</li>
<li>Friday – President Trump signs a trade deal with Mexico and Canada meant to replace NAFTA, congressional approval is still required.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Equity volatility continues to be elevated relative the past two years, although it is well within normal ranges. It is important to remember that a correction does not necessarily indicate a longer-term drop, nor is there a guarantee of a bounce back. During the recent correction, some of the largest sectors and companies were hit the hardest, specifically the Technology sector and “FAANG” stocks that have driven much of the positive market performance over the last two years. A portfolio that applied an equally weighted approach to sector and individual company allocation would have reduced risk and downside vs. a passive capitalization weighted investment like a low-cost index fund, for instance.</p>
<p>Investors who remained disciplined during the last two months have been rewarded this week with a global rally across most asset classes. While there is still quite a bit of geopolitical uncertainty top of mind, there were encouraging signs this week for global markets.</p>
<p>A slow down in the pace of rate raises in the U.S. may provide some relief to fixed income investments as rising rates are typically a headwind to fixed income prices. Additionally, this has the potential to slow or reverse the rise of the dollar which could provide relief to international developed and emerging market companies with dollar denominated debt and boost U.S. exports as they could become less expensive to international buyers.</p>
<p>A correction is often healthy, we have been in a record long bull market and bears have long considered the U.S. Equity market to be overvalued. We would much rather see natural corrections occur periodically than large bubbles form and burst. In addition, the potential for trade agreements to be reached and implemented may provide additional relief to global equity markets which have experienced substantial headwinds to growth.</p>
<p>It is certainly possible that global markets could continue their decline for an extended period, in which case the ability to remain disciplined and diversified should be valuable to investors. We believe that Personal Capital portfolios are well positioned to navigate choppy markets moving forward. As certain asset classes, sectors and companies are hit harder than others, opportunities to tax loss harvest and rebalance portfolios as prices drop will present themselves. By buying into asset classes as they fall, rather than rise, portfolios may be able to take advantage of lower prices, assuming of course, that over the long-term markets tend to rise.</p>

<p>Estate planning is something that everyone should pursue – regardless of the size of your estate. If you have minor children, life insurance policies, an IRA or other retirement accounts, health care savings accounts, real estate, bank accounts, or other personal property like a sentimental family heirloom, it’s important to dictate your wishes for your assets when you pass. While it can be difficult to consider your own mortality, it&#8217;s also important to clearly lay out your wishes to make the transition easier on your loved ones and avoid the probate process.</p>
<p>We recently performed a survey in partnership with ORC International that surveyed the estate planning wishes of both affluent Americans (defined as families with $500k+ of household investable assets) and GenPop parents (defined as families with less than $500k of household investable assets.</p>
<p>While there are many different types of estate plans and many different considerations that go into each (powers of attorney, beneficiary designations, estate taxes, gift taxes, and more), it&#8217;s important to understand the basics of your estate plan so that you can have a conversation with your loved ones and prepare them accordingly. Who are your beneficiaries? Who is inheriting what? What is the value of the estate?</p>
<p>What are your wishes for your estate plan? Take our assessment to see how your wishes compare to those of affluent Americans.</p>

<p>Many people associate trusts with the ultra-wealthy. In reality, however, trusts can be a great tool for a large number of people who want a tax-savvy means of passing their estate onto their heirs.</p>
<h2>What Is A Trust?</h2>
<p>A trust is a legal entity you set up to hold, safeguard, distribute and control all your assets. Some of the basic building blocks of a trust are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Property</strong> – The assets you place into the trust.</li>
<li><strong>Objective of the trust</strong> – There are different types of trusts tailored to meet a variety of estate planning objectives. For more information on the various types of trusts, see our comprehensive “<a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/whitepapers/guide-to-legacy-and-estate-planning/">Guide to Legacy &#038; Estate Planning</a>.”.</li>
<li><strong>Rules/ Provisions</strong> – Clauses in the trust that describe what is to be done with the assets under trust.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the trust to best carry out your intentions, decide what type of trust will suit your objectives, follow all the rules for that type of trust and make sure all the legal requirements continue to be met over time. We recommend finding and working with a local estate planning attorney to assist you in setting up and managing your trust.</p>
<p>There are several players involved in creating and administering a trust, including: </p>
<li><strong>Trustor</strong> (can also be referred to as <strong>grantor or settlor</strong>) – The person who sets up the trust.</li>
<li><strong>Trustee</strong> – Person(s) or entity that manages the trust’s assets.</li>
<li><strong>Beneficiary</strong> – Person(s) or entity that gets the assets in the trust.</li>
<li><strong>Successor trustee &amp; beneficiary</strong> – In some situations the trustor, trustee, and beneficiary are all the same person. For example, if you have a middle-class net worth, you might want the benefits that a trust provides but don’t want to pay someone else to manage it, especially if you are already doing most of the management as the owner of your assets. In cases like this, the person creating the trust will assume all of the roles and appoint a “successor trustee” and “successor beneficiary”.  The successor trustee takes over if and when the original trustee dies or declines to serve.  The successor beneficiary, as you might imagine, benefits from the trust.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Benefits Of A Trust</h2>
<p>There are many reasons to set up a trust. Some of the common benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoiding/reducing taxes</strong> – Avoiding or reducing <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/legacy-estate-planning/personal-capital-tax-series-3-protecting-your-legacy/">estate &#038; gift taxes</a> is probably the most popular reason why people set up a trust. For the year 2018, you will trigger estate taxes only after you have accumulated assets worth more than $11.2 million. That figure is based on an individual’s assets, so married couples can protect nearly $22.4 million from estate taxes.
<p>There’s an estate tax marital deduction, which exempts (at least until your spouse dies) all your estate, no matter how large, from federal estate taxes if your estate passes directly to your spouse. Effectively, this means few people need to worry about federal estate taxes. Some states, however, have estate tax provisions that kick in much earlier, so it pays to know the specific state laws where you live.
</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding probate</strong> – If you have a will, the assets included in your will must pass through the state’s probate process. The probate process is time consuming and depending on the state, it can cost anywhere from <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/how-much-does-probate-cost-3505268">3 to 8 percent</a> of your estate. A trust on the other hand can directly and quickly pass the assets to the beneficiaries.</li>
<li><strong>Protecting the estate</strong> – A properly constructed trust can protect the assets from the beneficiaries’ creditors and lawsuits.</li>
<li><strong>Retaining control of your estate</strong> – When setting up the trust you can dictate how and when you want the estate to be used.</li>
<li><strong>Providing support</strong> for minor children or dependents with special needs.</li>
<li><strong>Donating</strong> to charities in a tax efficient manner.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> – Terms of a will and the details of the assets left in a will are usually public while the terms of a trust are not.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Different Types Of Trusts</h2>
<p>There are many different types of trusts – some will serve a single purpose, others multiple. Some are set up to function while you are alive, while others work only after you die. Some can be changed, while others are irrevocable. Even though there are innumerable varieties of trusts, they can be classified into four basic kinds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revocable trust</strong> &#8211; This type of trust can be altered, amended or revoked by the settlor at any time.</li>
<li><strong>Irrevocable trust</strong> &#8211; In contrast to the revocable trust, an irrevocable trust cannot be altered once it is created.</li>
<li><strong>Inter-vivos trust</strong> &#8211; Also called a <strong>living trust,</strong> this trust is created while the settlor is still living.</li>
<li><strong>Testamentary trust</strong> &#8211; Also called a &#8220;will trust&#8221;, this trust is created at or following the death of the settlor based on the individual’s will.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the purpose of the trust, it can be further classified into many different types. Some of the common types include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marital trust (or “A” trust)</strong> &#8211; Provides benefits for the surviving spouse and the married couple’s heirs. A marital trust goes into effect when the first spouse dies.</li>
<li><strong>Bypass trust (or “B” trust):</strong> Created along with the “A” trust, maximizes the use of the decedent’s estate tax exclusion amount to lower taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Generation skipping trust</strong> &#8211; Lets your children use the assets, but keeps them out of the estate to avoid paying estate taxes, and ultimately passes the assets to the grandchildren.</li>
<li><strong>Special needs trust</strong> &#8211; Allows a person with special needs, to receive income without negatively affecting their ability to qualify for public assistance such as Social Security income and Medicare.</li>
<li><strong>Charitable lead trust</strong> &#8211; Is designed to reduce the taxable income of the beneficiaries by donating the income of the trust to a charity and after a specific period of time, transferring the assets to the beneficiaries.</li>
<li><strong>Charitable remainder trust:</strong> &#8211; The trust pays the beneficiaries for a specific period of time and then transfers the remainder of the trust to a charity.</li>
<li><strong>Spendthrift trust</strong> &#8211; Protects the assets from irresponsible beneficiaries and their creditors.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The Cost Of A Trust</strong></h3>
<p>There are a variety of costs associated with setting up and administering a trust. Some of these costs include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set up fees</strong> – This includes attorney fees for drafting the required documents such as a will and any durable powers of attorney. The cost of these fees will depend on the complexity of the trust and the size of the assets.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance fee</strong> – If you are appointing a bank or a trust company as the trustee (a “corporate trustee”), they will charge an annual administrative maintenance fee. This fee will depend on the value of the trust and the effort involved in maintaining the assets in the trust. For example, if all the trustee has to do is file the taxes for the trust, the fee will be significantly less than a trust that requires investment and real estate management. Most middle-class trusts are maintained by the trustor themselves, just as they were doing before creating the trust. The only difference is that now the properties will be in the trust’s name as opposed to the trustor’s name.</li>
<li><strong>Re-titling of the assets</strong> – After you set up a trust, the assets have to be transferred and re-titled to the trust’s name. The cost of this will vary based on the type and value of the asset and the state you live in.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to do most of the process yourself to save on costs, but given the complex laws surrounding estate planning, a small mistake could cost you or your heirs dearly. This is why we generally recommend hiring a reputable estate planning professional &#8211; better to get it right the first time! While hiring an attorney can be pricey, there are things you can do to save money, especially if you are paying an hourly rate.</p>
<p><strong>Before you set up the initial meeting, prepare a file with the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Why are you thinking of setting up a trust? What are your objectives?</li>
<li>List of all the assets you own and want the trust to hold.</li>
<li>Who will inherit your properties and on what conditions?</li>
<li>Proof of ownership, such as a deed and other title documents for the assets.</li>
<li>Recent appraisal documents, if applicable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How To Set Up A Trust</h2>
<p>When you meet with your estate planning attorney, you should discuss, based on your objectives, whether setting up a trust is right for you. You will also decide on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The specific type of trust you want to create.</li>
<li>Who will serve as the trustee.</li>
<li>Who will be the beneficiaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once those decisions are made, the process is generally pretty straight forward – your attorney will draft the trust agreement, a will, and the required powers of attorney.  Once set up, your trust will have its own Federal Tax Identification Number. The final step will be to transfer the assets from your name to the trust.</p>
<h2>The Rules Of A Trust</h2>
<p>The rules that govern a trust depend on the type of trust and are spelled out in the trust agreement. In general, a trust agreement may contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name of the trust.</li>
<li>Purpose of the trust.</li>
<li>Name of the trustee, successor trustee, beneficiaries and grantor.</li>
<li>How the property has to be controlled and by whom.</li>
<li>The powers and duties of the trustees.</li>
<li>How the property will be distributed.</li>
<li>General trust provisions (depending on the type of the trust).</li>
<li>How the trust rules may be altered.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Once a trust is set up, it takes its own identity.</strong> Every year the trust has to file taxes. Trusts (except living trusts, for which the income and deductions are reported on the personal income tax return) need to file a Form 1041, which deducts distributed interest from its own taxable income. The trustee also has to prepare Schedule K-1 forms for each of the trust’s beneficiaries, which tells them how much tax liability they may have from trust distributions. This Schedule K-1 will have to be included in each beneficiary’s personal tax return.</p>
<h2>Is Your Estate “Trust” Worthy?</h2>
<p>Trusts can be helpful for families of all sizes and incomes, but creating and administering a trust can be a complex, time consuming, and relatively expensive process. But what if you are caring for a child with special needs, have minor children, or want to leave your assets for a specific purpose, like the education of your descendants? In those cases, it might make sense to set up a trust even with a slightly lower net worth.</p>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>A trust that is set up in the right way can give you a greater amount of control over your wealth, as well as protect your legacy. But deciding whether to set up a trust, what type of trust is right for you, and what provisions to include totally depend on your individual circumstances and goals. Speak to a loved one about your long-term goals for your accumulated assets. If you decide that you are interested in creating a trust, consult an experienced estate planning attorney to confirm that it’s the best option for you and to guide you through the process.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Firstly, I’d like to say thank you to all of our clients and users. We here at Personal Capital deeply appreciate your trust and engagement, and we look forward to continuing to serve you all in the coming decades. Also, I would like to thank all my fellow employees here at the company &#8211; it is a privilege to work with so many intelligent, and motivated individuals. Thank you all. </p>
<p>This week in the markets we saw continued volatility, with two major US Indexes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&#038;P 500, closing below their 2018 starting points (notably, this is not the first time this has occurred this year). </p>
<p>Oil prices also continued their weeks long decline as concerns around oversupply and overall global economic strength continued to push prices lower. OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, will be meeting in early December to discuss output. As a point of interest OPEC was founded in 1960 and was originally comprised of 5 countries: Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran and Iraq. Currently there are 15-member countries who share <a href="https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/23.htm">OPEC’s Mission</a>:</p>
<p>“The mission of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is to coordinate and unify the petroleum policies of its Member Countries and ensure the stabilization of oil markets in order to secure an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consumers, a steady income to producers and a fair return on capital for those investing in the petroleum industry.” </p>
<h2>Weekly Returns</h2>
<p>S&#038;P 500: 2,633 (-3.8%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US(VEU): (-2.1%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 3.05% (-0.91%)<br />
Gold: $1,223 (0.1%)<br />
EUR/USD: 1.133 (-0.7%)</p>
<h2>Major Events</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monday – Markets declined with Technology stocks leading the way. Some of 2018’s high flying stocks such as Apple closed down significantly – Apple was down nearly 20% from its 2018 high on Monday.</li>
<li>Monday – The Price of a Bitcoin, worth nearly $20,000 a year ago, fell below $5,000.</li>
<li>Tuesday – President Trump continued to contradict the Central Intelligence Agency’s assessment from the prior week that Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman was involved in the killing of reporter Jamal Khashoggi. </li>
<li>Wednesday – US Markets rebounded from Monday and Tuesday’s declines.</li>
<li>Thursday – Happy Thanksgiving!</li>
<li>Thursday – While much of the US was celebrating a day of Thanks, the EU and UK closed in further on terms around Brexit.</li>
<li>Friday – Oil Prices continued their decline, with prices hovering between $50-$60 a barrel.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Monday and Tuesday’s market declines, followed by Wednesday’s bump, illustrate that uncertainty is keeping many investors on their toes – eager to avoid the next fall, or capture the next bump. </p>
<p>Here are several of the influential factors that are likely driving uncertainty: ongoing trade concerns between the US and China, economic growth and company earnings in the US, whether the Fed will continue to raise interest rates or will instead take a softer approach, and Brexit, to name a few.</p>
<p>I’ve had clients come to me over the past several weeks with very differing opinions on the near-term future of the markets – some thinking now may be the time to get out, others thinking now may be the time to buy. Everyone has an opinion, but our stance remains this: stay focused on a long term, diversified approach, that accounts for your personal goals, and your thoughts on risk. We have been doing this for years at Personal Capital, and if you’ve been thinking about better diversifying of late, consider speaking with an Advisor about your situation.<br />
With this said, we wish everyone an excellent weekend, and again, thank you!</p>

<h3><em>What do you want to be remembered for?</em></h3>
<p>It’s a question that most people contemplate at least once in their lives. Perhaps it’s the adventurous sense of spirit that takes you to all corners of the earth. Or maybe it’s the incredible kindness you show to your loved ones. But what about the impact you want to have with your more tangible assets?</p>
<p>This is where <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/category/legacy-estate-planning/">legacy and estate planning</a> can come into play.</p>
<p>So what is the difference between legacy planning and estate planning?</p>
<p>At a high level, estate planning ensures you have a plan for potential incapacity or death, and that your assets are distributed according to your wishes. Legacy planning is about giving your estate plan a sense of purpose. This may also include philanthropic goals in addition to family beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Despite how you categorize them, legacy and estate planning can be overwhelming – both financially and emotionally. And they require careful planning and strategic foresight to successfully provide for your current and future financial needs.</p>
<p>Personal Capital&#8217;s <em>Guide to Legacy and Estate Planning</em> is designed to help you understand the impact of what you leave behind, what you choose to give away, and all the complexities surrounding them.</p>
<p><em>*All legacy/estate planning and charitable giving analysis and insight provided are extended to you as a courtesy for educational purposes only. You should not rely on this information as the primary basis for legacy/estate planning and charitable giving decisions. We are not licensed legacy/estate planning and charitable giving professionals. You should consult a qualified licensed professional regarding your specific situation.</em></p>

					<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>PERSONAL CAPITAL STRATEGY: WHEN TO REVIEW YOUR LEGACY PLAN</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>Family member experiencing estate and/or health issues</li>
<li>Change in government policy and/or estate or tax law</li>
<li>A liquidity event or large changes in net worth</li>
<li>Changes in your relationship with your beneficiaries</li>
<li>A new beneficiary, such as a child</li>
<li>A move to a new state</li>
<li>Divorce</li>
<li>Marriage – first and especially second</li>
<li>More involvement with charity</li>
<li>Every five years based on potential changes in tax code</li>

					<p>The heart of an estate plan is figuring out what will happen to your property if you become incapacitated or when you pass away. It identifies the people you want to benefit from your assets, and those you trust to take care of them and yourself if you’re unable to do so.</p>
<p>Your estate includes property such as cash and securities, real estate, insurance, trusts, annuities, business interests, and other assets. When calculating your estate, the fair market value – not necessarily the purchase price – is used.</p>
<p>In addition to determining where your property should go, your estate plan will include decisions about children or other beneficiaries, taxes, probate, healthcare during life, and decisions to be made on your behalf during and after life.</p>

<p>When you review your estate planning goals with a local estate planning attorney, you will receive recommendations to establish powers of attorney, living will and a last will and testament. Depending on your own unique situation, your attorney may recommend a living trust or other more advanced estate documents based on your goals.</p>

<p>Many people wonder what goes into preparing an estate plan – whether you’re creating it from scratch or updating it. Here are some helpful items to think about and/or prepare when you meet with your estate planning attorney.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/assets/public/src/Prepare-and-Update-Estate-Plan.pdf">Download a PDF of this section here.</a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Establish who will administer your estate plan.</strong> This could be family, friends, or even a professional service.</li>
<li><strong>Decide who will be the primary and secondary heir(s) of your estate.</strong> This could be your spouse, family members, friends, and/or charitable beneficiaries.</li>
<li><strong>Have a snapshot or summary of your assets</strong> including their current market value, how they are titled/owned, account numbers, deeds, and related contact information. Some examples of these include:
<ul>
<li>Cash/bank accounts</li>
<li>Investment/brokerage accounts</li>
<li>Real estate</li>
<li>Retirement plans</li>
<li>Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)/educational savings plans</li>
<li>Life insurance policies</li>
<li>Annuities</li>
<li>Business ownership, proprietorships, or private partnerships you have an interest in</li>
<li>Any expected inheritance</li>
<li>Household property, such as jewelry, artwork, vehicles, or belongings of sentimental value</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Determine the key people</strong> who will be required to take action on behalf of your estate plan. These people may include: Who would be named your executor/trustee; the person who would make medical decisions on your behalf; and your designated guardian(s) for any minor or disabled children.</li>
<li><strong>Think through how you want your wealth distributed</strong> to your heirs (which may include any entity from your family and friends to your preferred charities)</li>
<li><strong>Find any existing estate plan from the past</strong> or any estate planning documents you need to review and/or update</li>
</ol>

					<p>A last will and testament is a legally binding document that distributes your assets and assigns executors, heirs and <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/legacy-estate-planning/naming-guardian-for-minor-children-in-will/">guardians</a> after your death. While people tend to think planning a will is morbid, it’s actually about life and making sure that your assets provide support for the people you love. According to a recent Gallup poll, only 44% of Americans have a will. Are you one of the majority without one?</p>
<p>If you do nothing else to take care of your legal affairs, you should at least write a will. If you don&#8217;t have a will before your death, your estate will be subject to state law guidelines and a judge may decide what happens with your estate and your beneficiaries.</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Requirements of a Will</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>Most states require the following for your will to be valid:</p>
<ul>
<li>You should be at least 18 years old.</li>
<li>You should be of “sound mind.”</li>
<li>You will need to include what you want done with your assets and property; if you have minor children, include who will become guardian.</li>
<li>Usually wills are typed or generated by a computer (handwritten wills have different provisions), and should include the statement that this document is your will.</li>
<li>You should appoint an executor who will ensure your estate is distributed correctly according to your will.</li>
<li>You should have at least two witnesses who are age 18 years or older, are not beneficiaries and who will see you sign the will.</li>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">What Happens if You Don&#039;t Have a Will?</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>If you pass away without a will, the intestacy laws of your state will determine what happens to your property and assets.</p>
<p>Typically, your spouse (domestic partner in some states) or children will be the first to inherit your assets; if you are not married and don’t have children, then other relatives may be the recipient of your estate. No relatives? The state usually receives your assets and property in that case. If you are not married, but have a long-term partner, then not having a will that clearly states how you intend your assets to be distributed can mean your final wishes will be ignored.</p>
<p>Since intestacy laws usually only recognizes relatives, you will want to clearly state your intentions in a will. The laws of succession vary based on what state you live in, so make sure you check to see what the laws are – or better yet, make sure you have a will. Contact an estate attorney to learn more.</p>

					<h3>Living Will/Advanced Directive</h3>
<p>A living will is a directive to medical professionals regarding preferences for end-of-life care if you unable to speak for yourself. A power of attorney for health care grants a trusted advisor the ability to navigate health decisions should you become incapacitated. In some states, both functions are combined in a single document, the advanced health care directive.</p>
<p>Two key considerations are your medical and financial powers of attorney. As the name suggests, a medical/healthcare power of attorney, which is a type of advanced directive, designates someone to manage your medical needs. This person would make any necessary healthcare decisions for you, communicate with doctors, and work with any other healthcare providers so that you receive the proper treatments.</p>
<p>A financial power of attorney, on the other hand, designates someone to manage your financial matters. It’s a simple, inexpensive, and reliable way to make sure you have a plan for financial decisions if you become incapacitated and unable to make decisions. You may not think that you need a financial power of attorney if you&#8217;re married. The truth is, designating one can make life much easier for your family to make financial decisions on your behalf if you become unable to do so.</p>
<p>Generally, a financial power of attorney allows your designated person to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transfer/withdraw funds for everyday expenses</li>
<li>File and pay taxes</li>
<li>Make mortgage payments</li>
<li>Make investment decisions</li>
<li>Make gifts</li>
<li>Hire someone to represent you in court</li>
</ul>
<h3>Powers of Attorney</h3>
<p>There are two types of powers of attorney.</p>
<p>Because such powers carry heavy responsibilities, you’ll want to verify that your powers of attorney are in place and still appropriate on a regular basis. Most financial companies will have their own power of attorney forms if you want to establish it on certain accounts. Some states will have their own forms that you can use for free as well. As long as you are mentally competent, you can always revoke any financial power of attorney.</p>

					<h3>Probate</h3>
<p>Probate is the process of the court deciding who receives the deceased’s assets. It is a costly, public process that delays the distribution of assets, and can cause strife if one or more people contest the will. In most cases the courts follow the will (if established), but the courts can be avoided by adding a beneficiary to retirement accounts or a Transfer on Death (T.O.D.) to a taxable account.</p>
<p>Trusts avoid probate, and are harder to contest. The average probate takes months before the inheritors receive assets. In many cases, about 5% -7% of the property has been eaten up by lawyers and court fees. Probate also results in a public record of your property and who received it, whereas a trust keeps this information private.</p>

					<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>PERSONAL CAPITAL STRATEGY: UPDATING YOUR WILL</strong></h3>
<p>Most people draft their will following a major life event like getting married or having a child – but then they don’t update it as their life progresses. More children, grandchildren, deaths, or divorce are just some of the life events that can change the will’s original intent.</p>
<p>If you have a will, you want to make sure it’s current, and written in a way that will avoid conflict for the rest of the family. You may want to consider the number of beneficiaries you have, or whether there are grandchildren to whom you wish to bequeath your property. Do you have a plan in the event that you and your spouse pass at the same time? An estate planning attorney and a financial advisor – even if there isn’t a trust involved – can be great resources.</p>
<p>Not having an updated will that reflects your current situation can cause strife within an already grieving family. Double-check your will on a regular basis to make sure it’s written to reflect your desires based on your current circumstances. <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management">Talk to your financial advisor to learn more.</a></p>

					<p>When it comes to estate planning, most people associate trusts with the ultra-wealthy. In reality, trusts can be useful for those who want a tax-savvy means of passing their estate onto their heirs, as well as helping determine how your property should be managed during life and beyond.</p>
<p>Trusts can be helpful for families of all sizes and incomes, but creating and administering a trust is a complex, time consuming and a relatively expensive process. The decision of whether to set up a trust – and if so, what type of trust to set up and what provisions to include – depends on your individual circumstances and goals.</p>

<h3>What is a Trust?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/legacy-estate-planning/setting-up-a-trust-fund/">A trust</a> is a legal entity you set up to hold, safeguard, distribute and control your property, i.e. the assets you place into the trust. There are several players who are involved in creating and administering a trust, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trustor – Also known as the “grantor” or the “settlor,” this is who sets up the trust.</li>
<li>Trustee – The person(s) or entity that manages the trust’s properties.</li>
<li>Beneficiary – The person(s) or entity that receives the assets in the trust.</li>
<li>Successor trustee – The successor trustee takes over if and when the original trustee dies or declines to serve.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you create a trust, you create rules and provisions that describe what is to be done with the assets under trust. For the trust to work best at carrying out your intentions, you usually decide what type of trust will suit your objectives, follow all the rules for that type of trust and make sure all the legal requirements continue to be met over time.</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Benefits of a Trust</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>There are many reasons to set up a trust. Some of the common benefits of creating a trust include (but are not limited to) those surrounding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taxes – Avoiding or reducing estate and gift taxes is probably one of the most popular reasons why people set up a trust.</li>
<li>Probate– If you have a will, the assets included in your will must pass through the state’s probate process, which can be time consuming and, depending on the state, costly. A trust on the other hand can directly and quickly pass the assets to beneficiaries.</li>
<li>Estate Protection – A properly constructed trust can protect the assets from the beneficiaries’ creditors and lawsuits.</li>
<li>Control– When setting up the trust you can dictate how and when you want the estate to be used.</li>
<li>Minors &amp; Dependents – Trusts can provide support for minor children or dependents with special needs.</li>
<li>Charitable Giving – Trusts can help you donate to charities in a tax-efficient manner.</li>
<li>Privacy – Terms of a will and the details of the assets left in the will are usually public while the terms of a trust are not.</li>

					<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>PERSONAL CAPITAL STRATEGY: IS A TRUST RIGHT FOR YOU?</strong></h3>
<p>Some factors to consider in determining whether a trust is the right vehicle for you include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re middle-aged or older, or in poor health</li>
<li>Simpler probate-avoidance methods aren’t available</li>
<li>You own out-of-state real estate</li>
<li>You’re concerned about privacy</li>
<li>You’re concerned about incapacity</li>
</ul>
<p>If your net worth is over $10 million, or you want to leave property to a person who has a disability or cannot be trusted to manage money, you may want to establish a more complicated trust. Of course, this isn’t a full list of considerations. Contact a financial advisor to determine whether a trust is right for you.</p>

					<h3>Types of Trusts</h3>
<p>There are different types of trusts tailored to meet a variety of estate planning objectives. Some of these serve a single purpose, while others serve multiple purposes. Some are set up to function while you are alive, while others work only after you’ve passed. Some can be changed, others are permanent (irrevocable).</p>
<p>Trusts can generally be classified into four basic types:</p>

<li>Bypass trust (or “B” trust): Created along with the “A” trust, maximizes the use of the decedent’s estate tax exclusion amount to lower taxes.</li>
<li>Generation-skipping trust: Lets your children use the assets, keeps them out of the estate to avoid paying estate taxes, and ultimately passes the assets to the grandchildren.</li>
<li>Special-needs trust: Allows a person with special needs to receive income without negatively affecting their ability to qualify for public assistance such as Social Security income and Medicare.</li>
<li>Charitable lead trust: Is designed to reduce the taxable income of the beneficiaries by donating the income of the trust to a charity and after a specific period of time, transferring the assets to the beneficiaries.</li>
<li>Charitable remainder trust: Works the other way; the trust pays the beneficiaries for a specific period of time and then transfers the remainder of the trust to a charity.</li>
<li>Spendthrift trust: Protects the assets from irresponsible beneficiaries and their creditors.</li>

					<h3>Trusts &amp; Taxes</h3>
<p>Once a trust is set up, it takes its own identity. Every year the trust has to file taxes.</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">The Basics of Filing Taxes for Trusts</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>Trusts (except living trusts, for which the income and deductions are reported on the personal income tax return) need to file a Form 1041, which deducts distributed interest from its own taxable income. The trustee also has to prepare Schedule K-1 forms for each of the trust’s beneficiaries, which tells them how much tax liability they may have from trust distributions. This Schedule K-1 will have to be included in each beneficiary’s personal tax return.</p>
<p>There are many different types of trusts and each one is taxed differently, depending on its structure. Usually a beneficiary does not pay taxes on distributions from the trust’s principal. Interest accumulated from money placed in the trust is usually taxable as income. The trust pays taxes on any interest income it holds; if a beneficiary receives income interest from the trust, then it is taxable to him or her.</p>
<p>From revocable/living trusts to irrevocable and testamentary trusts, trust taxation varies according to your own unique situation. Establishing a trust requires legal guidance, but you can start taking the right steps by scheduling time with a registered financial advisor.</p>

					<h3>Living Trusts</h3>
<p>A living trust is a trust you can create and make changes to (or revoke entirely) during your lifetime. The advantage to making one is that property left through the trust doesn&#8217;t have to go through probate court.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>More control of final distributions of assets, as well as protection against creditors (in the case of an irrevocable trust, in some states) are two common reasons for trusts. These trusts can be appropriate for people with more complicated situations and higher net worth. During your life, you, as the trustee, have complete control over the property in your trust. When you die, the person you named as &#8220;successor trustee&#8221; passes your trust property to the people you named as beneficiaries. This will spare your family the expense and delay of probate proceedings.</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">The Estate Tax</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>Currently, the U.S. tax system imposes an estate tax when a taxpayer passes away. Tax reform that passed last year means that every taxpayer has a credit against the estate tax that protects his or her first $11.18 million &#8211; up from $5.49 million.

					<p>For most people, the estate tax is no longer a real concern, especially when you consider the estate tax marital deduction, which exempts estate tax on assets that pass to a spouse. Even if you have $500 million when you die, there will be no estate tax if you leave it all to your spouse. However, once your spouse dies, the estate will likely have a large tax bill.</p>

					<p>If the estate tax is a concern for you, insurance may be used to pay the taxes on your estate so your heirs won’t have to sell assets to pay the taxes. You can also set up a life-insurance trust to be the beneficiary of the policy so that the death benefits won’t be taxed as part of the estate. Some states, however, have estate taxes at a lower taxable estate threshold, so it pays to know the specific state laws where you live. You should consult a professional for more information.</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">The Gift Tax</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>The gift tax differs from estate tax in that it applies to assets transferred during your lifetime. However, some taxpayers can take advantage of the annual exclusion associated with the gift tax, since using the annual exclusion can help reduce the overall value of your assets (if they don’t exceed the amount sheltered from federal estate taxes).</p>
<p>This exclusion allows you to give $15,000 in 2018 and 2019 (up from $14,000 in 2017) per year to any one person—and you can give this gift to as many people as you want, regardless of their relationship to you. Your spouse can also use the exclusion. These gifts do not count against the lifetime gift-tax exclusion for your potential heirs. This is where estate taxes and gift taxes become intertwined, at least at the federal level. Contact a professional to learn more about how gift taxes may impact you.</p>

					<p>One component of legacy planning that can make an impact on your heart and your estate is charitable giving. Giving to causes that are near and dear to you can reap many benefits, including financial ones, if you plan ahead and think a little bit strategically when it comes to donating.</p>
<p>Gifts from individuals are crucial to the nonprofit sector. In the United States, individual donors drove rise in philanthropic giving <a href="https://givingusa.org/see-the-numbers-giving-usa-2017-infographic/">$390.05 billion</a> in 2016. But many donors don’t leverage charitable giving to ensure their maximum impact, while remaining in sync with their broader financial strategy.</p>
<p>Treating your charitable giving as a part of your financial plan by creating a clear strategy and outlining goals means that you can give wisely, which doesn’t always translate to just giving more.</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Tax Benefits of Charitable Giving</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>While very few people donate only because of tax benefits, there are some tax breaks you can reap by giving. <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/charitable-contribution-deductions">The IRS currently allows you to deduct up to 50%</a> of your adjusted gross income during the tax year in which you make the charitable contributions if you itemize deductions. If you make cash donations to a public charity, then starting this year, you’re able to deduct 60% of your adjusted gross income during the tax year in which you make the contribution(s). Some contributions are limited to 30% of your adjusted gross income, and all contributions must be made – in cash or otherwise – before the close of the tax year in order to qualify for deductions in the current year.</p>
<p>If you donate property that isn’t cash to a qualified organization, the IRS generally allows you to deduct the fair market value of the property. Note that donating non-cash personal property has certain reporting requirements if the amount exceeds $5,000, regardless of when you make the contributions during the year. You will need to provide the IRS an appraisal of the value of the items prepared by a qualified appraiser, as well as complete the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8283">federal Form 8283</a>, Noncash Charitable Contributions and have it signed by both the charitable organization and the appraiser. Additionally, the signed Form 8283 must be attached to your filed tax return.</p>
<p>You can also use charitable giving to reduce tax liability on property you leave behind if the estate tax is a concern for you. There is an unlimited charitable deduction on your estate tax return.</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Gifting Appreciated Securities</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>You may be able to capture another tax benefit by giving appreciated securities. If you’ve held the securities for longer than a year, you can avoid paying capital gains taxes because you receive a tax deduction based on the security’s fair market value. (If you’ve held the securities for less than a year, then you receive a tax deduction on the lower of your cost basis or fair market value.) Plus, you can buy back the same security immediately and enjoy the higher adjusted cost basis.</p>
<p>The same goes for gifts of securities to friends or family; you can avoid paying capital gains on appreciated securities by gifting the shares to them. Note that the IRS allows you to make non-taxable gifts to any individual of $15,000 per year and up to nearly $11.2 million over your lifetime (indexed for inflation annually). This makes the most sense if the recipient is in a lower tax bracket, as he or she gets the original cost basis (the only time the step-up basis comes into play is when the investments are inherited).</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">IRA Withdrawals</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>For those who are taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from an IRA, a qualified charitable distribution (QCD) counts as an otherwise taxable distribution from anyone 70 ½ years old by year’s end (excepting ongoing SEP or SIMPLE IRAs), and can be excluded from gross income. This means a lower taxable income, which also may reduce the impact to certain tax credits and donations. Keep in mind while you won’t owe income tax on the distribution, you do not get a deduction.</p>
<p>You can elect to have all or part of this year’s IRA required distribution go to charity – or at least up to $100,000 annually (if you file taxes jointly, your spouse can also make a donation of up to $100,000 from his or her IRA within the same tax year). While charitable giving is usually restricted to less than 50% (60% starting in 2018) of your AGI to qualify for a deduction, giving directly from your IRA can help you reduce your AGI, even if the amount you give is greater than that 50%/60% limit.</p>
<p>Other restrictions apply, so you’ll want to consult a professional before using your IRA for charitable donations.</p>

					<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>PERSONAL CAPITAL STRATEGY: STEPS TO IMPROVE YOUR CHARITABLE GIVING</strong></h3>
<p>Where do you start when you want to maximize the impact of your giving? Here are a few simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start with a Goal</strong> – What is your end-game? Figure out what causes mean the most to you and align your strategy with what you care about.</li>
<li><strong>Do the Research</strong> – Inform yourself about what a charity offers and how your money will support that mission. Use <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/">Charity Navigator</a> or <a href="https://www.guidestar.org/home.aspx">GuideStar</a> to get transparency on your organization’s programs, revenue and expense numbers, and the amount of money it pays its leaders.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Results</strong> – If you seek to maximize impact, focus on long-term results and evidence of success and avoid funding nonprofits whose budgets are eaten up by costly marketing campaigns and unnecessary overhead. Use Charity Navigator to ensure your nonprofit is not only qualified, but highly and objectively ranked.</li>
<li><strong>Plan Your Contributions</strong> – The amount you want to give is personal. To calculate what is a feasible donation number, you will want to take into account what you make, what you want to save, and whether your financial condition is sufficient to meet your ongoing needs. Using our free tools will help you put charitable giving into perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalize on Tax Benefits</strong> – Giving is good for the heart and the wallet. Certain tax benefits may be available to you; consult a professional to ensure you’re getting the most bang for your buck.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>4 Things to Keep in Mind if You&#8217;re Trying to Max Out Your 401k</h1>
<p>No matter how much you might make, $19,000 is generally considered a good chunk of change. It’s the cost of a base model 2018 Honda Civic. For some, it’s the price tag on a first-class luxury vacation. It’s also the maximum amount you can contribute to your 401k in 2019 (if you are under 50 years old).</p>
<p>We’ve all heard the sage advice to “max out your 401(k)” whenever you can, since the earlier you start doing this, the earlier you start reaping the benefits of tax breaks and compounding interest over time. For 2019, the IRS increased the maximum contribution for people under 50 years old to $19,000, up $500 from 2018’s yearly limit of $18,500.</p>
<p>While everyone’s situation is different in terms of salaries, family situations, or employer matching programs, saving $19,000 per year boils down to around $1,583.33 per month. That’s $791.66 per paycheck, if you’re paid twice a month. (Note: employer contributions do not count toward this number.) It’s doable, but it’s a hefty sum if you haven’t honestly worked it into your monthly budget.</p>
<p>See if you’re on track to reaching your retirement goals with our <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software/retirement-planner">Retirement Planner tool</a>.</p>
<p>Here are four things to keep in mind if you’re trying to max out your 401(k) contributions this year:</p>
<h2>Take Stock of Monthly Payments</h2>
<p>For some of us, tucking away $19,000 seems easy in the grand scheme of things. However, don’t forget about the other expenses you have to prioritize. Imagine, for example, that you make $150,000 per year. After taxes, let’s estimate that your take-home pay is around $90,000 per year, approximately $7,500 per month. That’s nothing to sneeze at, but you also have a mortgage or rent payment to think about. The <a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/mortgages/average-monthly-mortgage-payment#by-income">national average monthly mortgage</a> at that income level is around $1,600. Now you’re down to $5,900 per month. Think about any debt you’re trying to pay down. According to <a href="https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/">Student Loan Hero</a>, the average monthly student loan payment is $351 (though you may want to <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/financial-planning-2/im-rushing-pay-student-loans-shouldnt-either-2/">think strategically</a> about rushing to pay off that loan). The average American has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/23/credit-card-debt-hits-record-high.html">$6,375</a> in credit card debt. Then there are other expenses — groceries, utilities, car payments, kid-related expenses, and other investments. Finally, factor in a $1,583.33 contribution to your 401k. Even though that contribution is pre-tax, your take-home pay may decrease faster than you realize, so it’s important to take a comprehensive look at your finances to understand what maxing out your 401k will look like on a month-to-month basis.</p>
<h2>Calculate What You Are Paying in Fees</h2>
<p>You could be paying hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime in hidden fees in your mutual fund, investing and retirement accounts. This means you think you’re saving all of your hard-earned money, but you’re actually losing a portion of your savings without even realizing it, just adding years onto your working life before you can retire. By using our <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software/fee-analyzer">fee calculator</a>, you can determine just how much you’re paying in hidden fees and, the impact to your portfolio over time. This will arm you with the information you need to change and optimize your investment strategy to maximize returns, which could be extra cash you can put toward your 401k.</p>
<h2>Be Strategic About Big Ticket Expenses</h2>
<p> Are you planning a huge blowout vacation? What about a second home? Even though these are “right now” purchases, they should be thought about in the framework of how they’ll impact you long-term, especially if you’re looking to max out your 401k contributions. Can you make your vacation into a 2-year plan, giving you more time to save up some cash, or use points-based rewards to upgrade your travel? Or are you thinking about<a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/whitepapers/guide-buying-vacation-home/"> buying a vacation home</a> by assessing what your goals are in making this purchase and how best to leverage financing and tax options. Big purchases are meant to give us joy, and hey, you’ve earned them. But thinking about them long-term in context of planning for retirement will go a long way when trying to hit that $19,000 annual amount.</p>
<h2>Take Advantage of Your Employer Contribution Plans</h2>
<p>An employer matching your contributions is like getting free money to sock away toward retirement. Make sure you understand what plan your employer offers and what that means for you. Most often, employers will match a percentage of your contributions – generally within 3% to 6% of your annual pay – although sometimes they will choose to match your contributions up to a specific amount. If your employer doesn’t match, see what it would take to negotiate that into your compensation package.</p>
<p>While $19,000 is large number to save considering all the other expenses you have in your life, with a little bit of strategic planning and adjustments, you should be able to work this into your financial strategy in 2019 – and beyond.</p>

					<h2>1. DONATE LONG-TERM APPRECIATED SECURITIES</h2>
<p>As we near the giving season, one way you can take advantage of an often overlooked charitable-giving tax break is by <strong><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/taxes-insurance/charitable-giving-donating-appreciated-assets/">donating appreciated assets</a></strong> instead of giving cash or writing checks to charities.</p>
<p>Tax reform may change the number of households that will utilize itemized deductions like the charitable contribution deduction (since the standard deduction has doubled). Still, many households will continue to itemize their deductions, which allows them to take advantage of this benefit. If you’re one of these households and you plan on donating to a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, it may make sense to gift long-term appreciated securities, like real estate, common stock, bonds, mutual funds held on a public exchange, or other securities.</p>
<p><code><br />
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vjxGnEALIwE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></code></p>
<p>Why does this benefit both you and the charity to which you give? First of all, the qualified recipient of your gift can receive the full benefit of the appreciated asset’s current market value. And for your own itemized deductions, you can usually deduct the full fair market value of those appreciated securities you’ve held for more than a year.</p>
<p>Another benefit of donating appreciated securities held long term is that you avoid paying capital gains tax on the appreciation. (Note there are very different rules for privately held securities. <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management">Speak to a financial advisor</a> to learn more). You can donate up to 30% of your adjusted gross income in appreciated assets to “public” charities before you are capped for the year. If you donate to a “private foundation,” then you can give up to 20% of your adjusted gross income. The excess will carry over for five years before being lost.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_testimonial_description">
					<div class="et_pb_testimonial_description_inner">
					<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>KEEP IN MIND&#8230;</strong></h3>
<p>Don’t contribute securities held less than one year. If you do, your deduction is the lower of market value or the cost basis. And you should likely never contribute securities at a loss; instead, sell them and take the capital loss, and then donate the proceeds.</p>

					<p>When you reach the age of 70 ½ and you have a traditional IRA, the IRS generally requires you to take a required minimum distribution (RMD) from it, even if you don’t necessarily need the money. If you are taking an RMD from your IRA (not an inherited IRA), then there’s a unique giving opportunity that can maximize your impact of giving as well as give you a potential tax benefit.</p>
<p>You can use part of your RMD from your traditional IRA as a <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/qualified-charitable-distributions/"><strong>qualified charitable distribution</strong></a> to a qualified charity. You can use a QCD to distribute up to $100,000 from your IRA to a qualified charity, which means your IRA distributions are not considered taxable income to you (although there is no charitable itemized tax deduction for a QCD). You don’t have to pay income tax on the distributions, but the donation helps satisfy the requirement for your minimum distribution. You must directly transfer your contribution from your IRA to the charity.</p>
<p>With the new standard deduction, this could be another way to reduce your taxable income in 2018 if you no longer can itemize your deductions.</p>

					<p>While giving is good for the heart, it can also be good for your financial picture and your tax bill. While giving is a great idea throughout the year, it tends to be toward the end of the year many of us consider donating. This includes giving tangible personal property, i.e., items that are in “good” used condition, such as clothing, household goods, electronics, furniture, and more.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-48892 aligncenter" src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/donate-tangible-property-end-of-year-tax-tips-300x147.jpg" alt="donate tangible property end of year tax tips" width="600" height="294" srcset="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/donate-tangible-property-end-of-year-tax-tips-300x147.jpg 300w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/donate-tangible-property-end-of-year-tax-tips-768x377.jpg 768w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/donate-tangible-property-end-of-year-tax-tips-952x467.jpg 952w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/donate-tangible-property-end-of-year-tax-tips-1080x530.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>When you donate, be sure to get a receipt when you drop off your property (or have them pick it up) and be diligent about writing down what you donated. Determine a reasonable “thrift shop” value for those goods and claim that amount as a charitable contribution. If the aggregate of the goods donated in a single year of similar items (such as clothing and household goods) exceeds $5,000, regardless of when they are contributed, you will need to have a qualified appraiser prepare a professional appraisal of all the items you donated.

<p>At the federal level, estate taxes can be intertwined with the gift tax (the gift tax applies to the value of assets transferred to others during your lifetime). Typically, if you give more than $15,000 (2018), then this begins to count against your lifetime estate tax exemption of nearly $11.2 million. These annual $15,000 gifts, however, don’t count against the lifetime gift-tax exclusion for your potential heirs, so the annual exclusion associated with the gift tax can reduce the overall value of your estate during your lifetime, without impacting your lifetime estate tax exemption. This can be complex, so you can <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management">consult a professional</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>You can also make unlimited payments directly to medical providers or educational institutions on behalf of others without incurring a taxable gift or using up your lifetime exemption.</p>

The 2018 limits are $18,500 (plus an additional $6,000 if you are over 50 years of age.)

					<p>One of the most common tax-advantaged retirement accounts is the Roth IRA. These can be a great way to save if your tax rate in retirement will be similar or higher than your current tax rate. You don’t get a tax deduction when you contribute, but your withdrawals in retirement are tax free (though you should keep in mind that if you’re already in the 24% or higher federal tax bracket, you probably can’t – and probably shouldn’t – contribute to a Roth).</p>
<p>Because of these potential tax advantages, a common tax management question that can arise is: should you convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA? If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/taxes-insurance/roth-conversions-rules-strategies/"><strong>Roth conversion</strong></a> may be something to investigate further. A side note about the terminology that can be confusing: a “contribution” and a “conversion” are completely different in the world of retirement accounts. For high income earners, contributions to a Roth are limited, but most taxpayers can convert assets to a Roth IRA.</p>
<p>Note that on the surface, a Roth might appear superior since its tax-exempt nature amplifies compounding investment returns over time. It’s not quite this simple, however – several criteria must be met in order for a Roth conversion to make sense.</p>

<p>So when exactly do you need to take your first RMD? As mentioned, you must take your first RMD for the year in which you turn age 70 ½ ; however the first payment can be delayed until April 1 of the year following the year in which you turn that age.

<p>2018 federal and state fourth quarter estimated tax payments are traditionally due on January 15. In the past, worrying about whether to make state estimated tax payments early was an issue if you faced the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) or if you were concerned about maximizing the deduction for those not facing AMT. With taxes for itemized deductions now being limited to $10,000 per year, this will be less relevant for most people; however it still may be something to consider as we near the yearend.</p>
<p>The basic premise of estimated tax payments is that taxes are due when the income is earned. IRS rules state that (in general) you must pay 90% of your current year tax liability or 100% (110% if your AGI is more than $150,000 for the prior year) of your prior year tax liability. You can’t just make a fourth quarter payment if your income is earned throughout the year; generally, you must match payments in the quarter when the income is earned. However, there are exceptions to that rule.</p>
<p>The regulations for making estimated taxes are complex and you should work with a tax advisor on how they apply to their situation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The past week was full of familiar themes and big moves ahead of the shortened holiday trading week.  </p>
<p>There were flashes of 2015 energy price drops and 2016 Brexit headlines, but it was the continued 2018 themes of tech routs and U.S./China trade agreement concerns that reminded everyone it is in fact the year 2018.  </p>
<p>Stock earnings throughout the week came in with mixed results, adding to the landmines scattered throughout all areas of the market.  Another big move was in PG&#038;E stock which fell over 50% in a two-day period, followed by a 36% jump Friday over speculation on the company’s involvement in the Northern California Campfire. The wildfire was declared the deadliest in state history with over 600 people still missing, 63 confirmed fatalities, 142,000 acres burned, 11,862 structures destroyed, and still only 45% contained according to Cal Fire and local officials as of Friday morning.  </p>
<p>Several air quality measuring apps have declared Northern California air quality not only hazardous, but currently the worst in the world.  If you live in Northern California, it is recommended to avoid going outdoors or to wear a proper mask when you do.     </p>
<h2>Weekly Returns</h2>
<p>S&#038;P 500: 2,736 (-1.61%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US (VEU): (+0.04%)<br />

Gold: $1,222 (1.0%)<br />
EUR/USD: 1.1414 (0.69%)</p>
<h2>Major Events</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monday – Concerns over weakening iPhone demand battered tech stocks.</li>
<li>Tuesday – Amazon announced New York City and Northern Virginia for its new headquarters.</li>
<li>Tuesday – Oil Prices plunged the most since 2015 on over-supply fears and recorded a record 12th straight day of declines.</li>
<li>Wednesday – Slowing global growth concerns weighed on markets halting rally attempts.</li>
<li>Thursday – A day after a draft Brexit deal was announced, six government ministers, including Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, resigned.  The British pound plunged 2% against the U.S. dollar after the announcement; the most since July 2016.</li>
<li>Thursday – Markets rebounded on optimism over a written response from China to U.S. demands for trade reform ahead of the upcoming G20 summit.</li>
<li>Friday – Chip stocks continued their fall; Nvidia missed earnings and decreased their outlook.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Although this week’s market-moving headlines are not unfamiliar, there are some key items to point out.  The tech sector has largely been the juggernaut leading the market to recent highs and subsequently, leading the correction down.  The broad technology ETF QQQ is down about 10% from its high, but there have been some alarmingly large moves specifically in the semiconductor space.  Chip companies like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have corrected around 40% in only about a month and half!  Around half of those moves came after reporting weak earnings and outlook for the industry.  Apple though, is what initially sparked this week’s tech rout dropping 5% Monday after one of its suppliers, Lumentum Holdings (down over 30% from recent highs), cut its earnings and revenue outlook.  What is key to know here is that semiconductors are very cyclical and generally are perceived as a bellwether for economic growth, especially now in this tech-driven market cycle.  Most Chip companies also have large exposure to China, which has caused them to also get caught up in the crosshairs of trade war concerns.  We are not bearish on the technology sector but do think that these developments should be watched closely.</p>
<p>Regarding the most recent developments on the U.S. and China trade talks, Beijing responded with a written document to a U.S. request from a few months back for commitments intended to lead to trade talks.  Per a Reuters report an official said, “The Chinese document included 142 items divided into three categories: issues the Chinese are willing to negotiate for further action, issues they are already working on and issues they consider off limits.”  The fact that China sent a written response was cause for some optimism ahead of the G20 Summit, but some officials such as Wilber Ross, U.S. Secretary of Commerce, were quick to curb such reactions suggesting only a framework would be agreed upon head of a meeting.  President Trump had a bit more of an optimistic tune saying, “China wants to make a deal, they sent a list of things they are willing to do which is a large list and it is just not acceptable to me yet, but at some point I think that, we are doing extremely well with respect to China,” per a Bloomberg report on Friday.  Despite some optimism over these developments, it is important to keep in perspective that China has made promises on trade reforms before and not followed through.  The G20 summit, set for the end of the month, will be a key event to follow and likely market moving.</p>
<p>The ongoing trade disputes between the U.S. and China have been one of the major reasons for renewed fears of slowing global growth.  That combined with the huge drop in oil prices this week over supply concerns brought back fresh memories from three years ago when the energy rout brought down global markets on slowing global growth concerns.  We don’t know where the market will go from here, but we will continue to monitor these warning signs closely and keep you informed.  One thing is clear, the recent market correction has woken up those who have become complacent and serves as a humbling reminder of how quickly and sharply markets can change.     </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is roughly <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2016/06/11/unclaimed-life-insurance-money-payout/85718732/">$7.4 billion</a> of unclaimed life insurance money in the U.S. Many family members are unaware that their loved ones held a life insurance policy and are “oblivious beneficiaries.” Could you be owed a life insurance payout?</p>
<h2>Why is There So Much Unclaimed Life Insurance Money?</h2>
<p>It can be easy to underestimate the amount of important paperwork and documentation that accumulates over a person’s lifetime. This reality becomes painfully clear when you lose someone close to you such as a spouse or parent and face the legal, emotional, and financial aftermath of that person’s affairs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, life insurance documentation is often lost or overlooked when people pass away. Life insurance is often used to leave an <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/family-life/how-to-handle-large-windfall/">inheritance</a> for loved ones, but it is not uncommon for an older person to forget about life insurance policies acquired earlier in life.</p>
<p>Additionally, life insurance companies are very unlikely to dispense a death benefit unless the beneficiary makes a claim. They must be notified and given a copy of the death certificate before the claims process can begin. It’s quite common for bereaved people to forget about their status as a beneficiary, and it’s also very common for beneficiaries to be unaware that their loved one held a life insurance policy in the first place. Policy owners can sometimes fail to properly communicate the facts (or even the existence) of their policy or what steps need to be taken to claim a death benefit.</p>
<p>If you have lost a loved one – perhaps a spouse, a parent or another close family member – you may be entitled to unclaimed benefits from life insurance you were unaware the deceased had. You could be the beneficiary of a policy right now without realizing it.</p>
<p>If you suspect the existence of a policy you might benefit from, you should take it upon yourself to search for it. However, you’ll need to know where to start looking since life insurers typically do not automatically dispense benefits upon the death of a policyholder.</p>
<h2>How to Find Out if You Have Unclaimed Life Insurance Money</h2>
<p>If you think a deceased loved one or parent carried a life insurance policy that was not disclosed to you, here are 7 ways to find out:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Your Filing Cabinet</strong> – You’ll probably find your first clue deep in old paperwork. If you come across any correspondences or old premium notices from Life Insurance Company X, you’re onto something. Call the insurance company. They’ll have to verify your identity and get a copy of the policyholder’s death certificate (with social security number), but the claims process shouldn’t be much more difficult than that.</li>
<li><strong>Online Search Service </strong>– There are online services that specialize in unclaimed money. The <a href="https://www.unclaimed.org/">National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators</a> (NAUPA) is one such service and NAUPA-endorsed missingmoney.com is another search database resource worth checking out.</li>
<li><strong>State Insurance Department</strong> – You can also contact your state insurance department (insurance is regulated at the state level). They may have some helpful information, but don’t be too hopeful. They don’t typically devote any significant resources to sorting out unclaimed money issues.</li>
<li><strong>Bank Statements</strong> – Was the filing cabinet a dead end? The bank might have some good information. Do a search for canceled checks to locate past premium payments and find out which insurance company they were sent to.</li>
<li><strong>Check With Other Insurance Agents or Brokers</strong> – Check with the deceased’s homeowner’s and auto insurance agent to see if they may have also sold a life insurance policy.</li>
<li><strong>Contact former employers and unions</strong> – The deceased may have purchased a life insurance plan through work. Also check with any unions or other professional organizations to see if they offer life insurance to their members.</li>
<li><strong>Medical Information Bureau</strong> – A final resort for locating a lost life insurance policy is to contact the Medical Information Bureau, Inc. MIB is a consumer reporting agency and storehouse of consumer information collected from health and life insurance entities. For a fee, they will conduct a search for a policy that you are looking for.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Keep Communication Lines Open</h3>
<p>If you are a policy holder, make sure your beneficiaries know about the benefits to which they are entitled. They need to know what benefits they stand to gain and how they can acquire them through a claims process. Keep a copy of insurance statements in a safe place with other important estate documents so that beneficiaries will be aware of active policies. If you have lost a loved one, regardless of how long ago, it may be worth your while to investigate the possibility of a death benefit waiting in limbo for you to make a claim; you might be pleasantly surprised.&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

					<p>3 Security Tips to Help Protect You During the Holidays</p>
<p>We are sliding headfirst into the holidays, and while that may mean it’s the most wonderful time of the year for some of us, it’s certainly a joyful season for one group: fraudsters.</p>
<p>‘Tis the season for arguing with family over politics, gaining extra pounds from delicious food, taking advantage of all those fantastic deals that happen on Black Friday and Cyber Monday &#8212; and giving fraudsters a chance to engage in seasonally-themed fraud schemes.</p>
<p>Last year, fraudulent activity was expected to rise 30% during the holidays compared to the same period in 2016. This could include anything from <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/family-life/the-financial-cost-of-identity-theft/">identity theft</a> or privacy beaches to phishing attacks and account takeovers.</p>
<p>So what are the best ways to protect yourself during a time when your wallet may be opened more than usual, potentially exposing you to more risk than during other times of the year?</p>
<h2>Be Mindful During Travel</h2>
<p>Are you one of the millions of Americans traveling during the holidays? Last year, AAA predicted that 50.9 million Americans would travel for Thanksgiving, and more than double (107.3 million) would travel between December 23 and January 1. If you are planning on taking your holiday show on the road, keep in mind that travel can take you out of your normal routines where your instincts would help you more. As you plan your travel, you are likely to engage with new and unfamiliar websites so take a minute to ensure you don’t end up in a fake phishing site.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_testimonial_description">
					<div class="et_pb_testimonial_description_inner">
					<p>Did you know? If you travel via air this holiday, be careful with your boarding pass as the barcode contains sensitive personal information! Make sure you dispose of it safely.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">
					<p></p>
<p>While it’s tempting to use the free WiFi in airports or lounges, proceed with caution: there are not only some fake connections that fraudsters can create, but even the legitimate ones can get hacked at times. If you’re using public WiFi, then be conscientious about what accounts you are logging into, and of course, use caution when doing anything surrounding your finances. If your computer or phone has a Virtual Private Network (VPN) feature, that can help mitigate the risk of public WiFi.</p>
<p>Another important security measure to keep in mind during holiday travel is to avoid announcing when you will be away from your home on social media (especially if it is public). If your home will be unattended while you are traveling, it’s generally inadvisable to alert fraudsters to that fact!</p>
<h2>Monitor Your Accounts on a Regular Basis</h2>
<p>A good way to protect yourself against financial fraudsters &#8211; during the holidays or all throughout the year &#8211; is to monitor your accounts and transactions. If you see something fishy, then you can report it to the correct institution right away. By using financial tools like Personal Capital’s dashboard, you can easily track all of your accounts from one single secure login, which means you don’t need to sign in to each account individually to monitor activity. This also means that you are less likely to have important banking passwords stolen.</p>
<p>None of your personal information, such as your Social Security number or other identifying information (including access to your bank accounts), is stored in your Personal Capital dashboard, so you can track your finances without wondering if you’re exposing sensitive information. It is also impossible to move or steal any money from the dashboard, making it a safe and convenient way to review your transactions.</p>
<h2>Operational Security</h2>
<p>Finally, plan as if you are being targeted for fraud or a scam. It’s unfortunate, but every year devices get lost or stolen, and people fall victim to digital scams. Back up your data so you don’t lose cherished family pictures or other important data. Make sure your devices are encrypted and have passwords, so you have a good first line of defense against thieves or scammers.</p>
<p>The best thing you can do to ensure the safety of your accounts is to enable the use of Multi-Factor Authentication wherever possible. Personal Capital uses multi-factor authentication by default for your login, so in the off chance that your password is compromised, your account still will likely not be accessed.</p>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Financial fraud occurs all the time, but it’s especially prudent to be aware of this during the holiday season and take steps to protect your finances. The consequences of fraud varies &#8211; some of it can be easily rectified within a few days, while other types have years of lasting impact. The difference between the two is early detection. That’s why we encourage you to track your accounts from one place with real-time data on all your transactions &#8212; during the most wonderful time of the year and beyond.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a busy week with the midterm elections, the Fed’s policy meeting, as well as ongoing quarterly earnings announcements. There was a strong global rally leading up to the midterms, which continued through Wednesday after most results had been announced. This allowed U.S. stocks to stay nicely positive, despite a nasty selloff on Friday. Foreign developed stocks ended the week flat, while emerging markets posted declines. Commodities were also down after concerns over increasing supply pushed oil prices near bear market levels. </p>
<h2>Weekly Returns</h2>
<p>S&#038;P 500: 2,781 (+2.1%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US (VEU): (-0.4%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 3.18% (-0.04%)<br />
Gold: $1,210 (-1.9%)<br />
USD/EUR: $1.134 (-0.4%)</p>
<h2>Major Events</h2>
<li>Monday – Reports surfaced that Amazon plans to split its second headquarters between two locations rather than one.</li>
<li>Monday – The U.S. ratcheted up sanctions on Iran targeting oil and Iranian banks, although it issued waivers to a handful of countries including China, Japan, India and Italy.</li>
<li>Tuesday – U.S. voters hit the polls to cast their ballots in the much anticipated midterm elections.</li>
<li>Wednesday – A former Marine killed 12 people at a country-music bar near L.A. before killing himself. Investigators are still searching for a motive.</li>
<li>Thursday – The U.S. Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged following its two day policy meeting, but set the stage for future rate hikes with its upbeat assessment of economic growth.</li>
<li>Friday – U.S. producer prices rose 0.6% in October, the biggest monthly increase since 2012.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>After all the hype, the midterm elections are finally over. Turns out there was not a massive “blue wave”, nor was there a Republican sweep. Instead, results turned out almost exactly as expected. Congress is now split with Democrats taking the House, and Republicans maintaining control of the Senate. So what does this mean moving forward? </p>
<p>Well, markets definitely rallied on Wednesday. Perhaps investors were cheering the fact that a split Congress makes it less likely any major legislation will pass. Or maybe markets were glad the blue wave never materialized, making it more likely the tax cuts are here to stay. Another possibility: maybe everyone was simply relieved they don’t have to listen to all those annoying political ads anymore. Regardless, now that the election is over, it does remove a bit of uncertainty. This is something investors tend to like. And markets historically have rallied following midterm elections, especially in the subsequent calendar year where returns have averaged roughly +17.9% going back to 1927. </p>
<p>But will history repeat itself? Very tough to say. Whatever the reason for Wednesday’s big rally, it certainly appears fleeting. Both Thursday and Friday’s consecutive market declines suggest reality has once again set in. Because at the end of the day, nothing has fundamentally changed in the macroeconomic backdrop. The trade war is still ongoing, and it’s doubtful the election results will prompt any sort of speedier resolution. Moreover, strong U.S. economic growth continues to warrant further rate increases. In fact, there wasn’t a single mention of October’s market slide in the Fed’s policy statement. </p>
<p>So despite this being a particularly noisy week, markets are picking up right where they left off. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do we know about the basics of investing? Buy low sell high. Diversify. Invest for the long-term. Sounds easy, but it’s not. Every day I talk to investors who understand these concepts but have difficulty executing them. For many, the gap between the knowledge of what they should do and what they are actually able to do on their own is the main reason they work with a financial advisor.</p>
<p>However, there are still a significant amount of people who decide to self-manage their investments, and the vast majority of these people negatively impact their overall financial portfolio and underperform the market. Why? Because emotion, biases, and simply human nature can interfere with their ability to make sound financial decisions. Especially <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/market-volatility-how-will-you-react/">during times of market volatility</a>, it’s imperative to understand the impact that your emotions and unconscious biases can have on the overall performance of your investing portfolio.</p>
<h2>The Realities of Emotional Investing</h2>
<p>One of these unconscious biases that many investors experience is that we all have a natural inclination to want to own what has done well recently. It makes us feel better. It makes for a good story at a cocktail party to say that we made a big bet on the latest-greatest investment. This effect is common enough that it has its own name: recency bias. Recency bias is the tendency to think that trends and patterns in the recent past will continue in the future, which then impacts certain conclusions, decisions or behaviors. However, recency bias doesn’t make for a good long-term investment strategy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170301006175/en/New-DC-Pulse-Survey-BlackRock-Employees%E2%80%99-Retirement">According to a BlackRock survey</a> of retirement plan participants, 66% of surveyed workers believe that over the next decade, returns on their savings will continue to be in line with what they have experienced in the past, while 17% believe they will experience even higher returns. This shows how this type of bias can be particularly dangerous during periods of rising markets because it can grow stronger as the market reaches higher peaks. For example, a lengthy bull market can lull us into a false sense of security, which can translate into trouble – how do you think asset bubbles are created?</p>
<p>Recency bias works the opposite way, too, when you experience negative events. In 2008, for example, many investors quickly determined that the negative events of the stock market crash would continue and liquidated their investment portfolios. When the financial markets rebounded, many of those same investors realized their error and jumped back into the markets. Unfortunately, they locked in their financial losses and bought back in after much of the recovery had already happened. Recency bias cost those investors a lot. During market volatility, it&#8217;s important to stick to your long-term investing strategy and avoid assuming that recent events will continue indefinitely.</p>
<p>We also know we need to diversify, but what does that really mean? It means owning a variety of asset classes, including those that are out of favor. It means buying some more of these asset classes when they don’t do well. Investments are often cyclical so that today’s “must have” is tomorrow’s “has-been”. In other words, a good portfolio has assets that have a negative correlation – when one part of the portfolio goes up another tends to go down. How else can you buy low and sell high if nothing is down when something else is up? This is another pitfall for many investors and is a common subject for analysis by behavioral economists. It’s no fun watching parts of your portfolio go down. Investors can easily make poor investing decisions from seeing some areas of their portfolio decline. But having the discipline to rebalance with your long-term goals in mind will ultimately help drive the best results.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Avoid Emotional Investing</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.personalcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/emotion-4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44462" src="http://blog.personalcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/emotion-4.png" alt="Emotional Investing" srcset="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/emotion-4.png 750w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/emotion-4-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="http://cuffelinks.com.au/investing-against-the-herd-part-1-resisting-emotion/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://cuffelinks.com.au/investing-against-the-herd-part-1-resisting-emotion/</a></p>
<p>Successful long-term investing means not chasing results or trying to time your entry/exit into the market. The above graphic is a good illustration of what usually happens when we try and do either. Again, the counterpoint to emotional investing is having a long-term goal and a strategy in place. There will be ups and downs along the way, but your goals will always remain clear.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://blog.personalcapital.com/investing/brain-will-make-poor/">our brains are wired to want to chase results</a> and make emotional decisions. We know we are supposed to buy low and sell high, but our brains often trick us into buying into the hot investment (buying high) and then selling it when it doesn’t work out (selling low).</p>
<p>According to DALBAR, most individual investors dramatically trail the market. In their <a href="https://www.qidllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-Dalbar-QAIB-Report.pdf">22nd Annual Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior</a>, DALBAR examined the behavior of mutual fund investors over the 30-year period ended December, 2015.</p>
<p>The annualized return for the S&amp;P 500 over that time period was 10.35%. The annualized return for the average equity investor? Just 3.66%! DALBAR found that “…investor behavior is the number one cause” of underperformance. They further explain, “The data shows that when investors react, they generally make the wrong decision.”</p>
<p>Professionally managed funds are often not much better. <a href="http://www.aei.org/publication/more-evidence-that-its-very-hard-to-beat-the-market-over-time-95-of-financial-professionals-cant-do-it/">80% of large-cap active managers underperformed their benchmark over a 3 year period</a>. The same problems that individuals run into when they chase results occur with professionals as well. On top of paying higher fees for active professional management, you’re still likely to get sub-par results.</p>
<p>Given this reality, it certainly sounds appealing to go to a discount broker and do it yourself. However, this self-directed &#8220;supermarket approach&#8221; of picking a few stocks and funds that look appealing isn’t much better. Despite our best intentions, our cognitive biases (like wanting to follow the crowd and seeking out information that conforms to our beliefs) will come into play. It&#8217;s nearly impossible for an individual to eliminate these emotional biases that inevitably lead to poor investment decisions.</p>
<h2>Emotion-Free Investing is Hard&#8230;but It&#8217;s Possible</h2>
<p>Because like most people, you will probably have difficulty separating emotion from your decision-making, it’s probably best to stay an arm’s length away from day-to-day investing decisions. This is one of the biggest benefits of working with a <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management/financial-advisors">financial advisor</a> who will focus on a sound, long-term investment strategy without chasing short-term results. Investors should work with a company that is a fiduciary to ensure that the investor’s best interest will always come first. Investing in a wire house that has an incentive to put your money in their products or products from which they get a kick back is unlikely to be in an investor&#8217;s best interest.</p>
<p>And for some peace of mind, turn off the 30-second stock market updates on your phone. Paying too much attention to the short-term noise in the markets can cause us to make knee-jerk decisions that will be detrimental to our overall performance. It&#8217;s often far better to understand your portfolio&#8217;s long-term benefits and strategy and ignore the short-term ups and downs.</p>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Over the past 100 years, there have been good market periods and bad market periods. Overall, markets have expanded, and investors have been richly rewarded. There will always be concerns and fears about what will happen next, and there will be bear markets in the future. Those who expect otherwise will be disappointed and may react as a result of their disappointment.</p>
<p>Developing a solid investment strategy – and then keeping your emotions in check and sticking to it – is the best thing you can do to achieve your long-term financial goals, regardless of what is happening in the markets.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Volatility returned to US stocks in October, providing a reminder of the benefits of diversification at both the asset class and sector level.</p>
<p>Major US indexes flirted with correction territory before rebounding in the final two days. International stocks, which were already having a difficult 2018, neared a 20% decline from January highs.</p>
<p>The cause of market corrections is often difficult to attribute, even in retrospect. We believe two speeches early in the month helped accelerate selling pressure. The first was from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell who said that interest rates are a long way from neutral, and that we may go past neutral. This wasn’t new news, but after a decade of a very accommodating Fed under Bernanke and Yellen, it was a wake-up-call that we are in a new environment for monetary policy. The second was from Vice President Pence who painted an adversarial picture of the relationship between the US and China. The implication is that the trade war will persist or perhaps intensify. We’re cautiously optimistic there will be progress on trade at the G20 meeting later this month, but a quick fix remains unlikely.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, earnings growth continues to be robust and the economy is chugging ahead. Earnings haven’t all been rosy, however, as investor favorites Amazon and Apple offered disappointing guidance, sending tech shares lower. In the US, the sell-off in stocks was sharp and came out of nowhere. That is typically more characteristic of a correction rather than the start of a bear market. Thinking globally, however, stocks have been generally in a flat or downward pattern since the end of January.</p>
<p>It is impossible to know where markets go from here, but recent market activity has served as a reminder that investors should be aware of their allocations and the drivers of risk in their portfolios.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Planning and saving for <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/category/retirement-planning/">retirement</a> and your children’s <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/category/college-planning/">education</a> are common financial goals.</p>
<p>They are also two of the biggest challenges for families today. How do you plan for an unknown future that requires so much upfront planning? And how do you balance wanting to save for your child&#8217;s future with saving for your own? Here is some guidance in thinking about these two in tandem.</p>
<p><code><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b9zzJBjw0_s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></code></p>
<h2>Prioritizing Retirement</h2>
<p>Saving for your children’s education is obviously important. But, even if you’re confident your child will attend college, max out any retirement savings account options – such as a 401k (especially if your company matches) or IRA – before you fund a 529 college savings plan or any other education-specific account. The tax deduction and long deferred growth of retirement accounts tends to outweigh the tax-deferred growth in your 529 for a shorter period of time. If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, you should also contribute to that account before a 529. The principal can be pulled anytime, including for education expenses.</p>
<p>You should not sacrifice your retirement for your children’s education. You can always borrow or apply for financial aid for college costs; you can’t borrow for your retirement. When it comes to college planning, the interest rates for federal student loans – the types of loans your children might take out if they need to – are usually less than what you can make by putting your money in retirement investments.</p>
<h2>Career Projections and When to Save</h2>
<p>Income varies over a career, and there are different strategies and optimal times to save for retirement vs. education. Understanding your projected career and salary trajectory helps in knowing when and how to save. After all, the salary you earned at 24 is likely not the same two decades later.</p>
<p>When looking at different ways to pay for your child’s education, keep in mind that you will most likely earn more later in life. So as your child grows, so will your salary, which can be important when thinking about planning for the entire family. When you are making the most money, this may be the optimal time to think about saving for both your child’s education as well as your retirement.</p>
<h2>Determining Your Retirement Goals</h2>
<p>Much of all of this is predicated on how you envision your retirement lifestyle. After all, how do you know how much you can put toward your child’s future if you don’t know how much you need for your own? It’s important to understand what kind of retirement you want. Pick a date, track your budget, know your cash flow, and remember to always look at your finances in a “big picture” way.</p>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>There is a huge amount of information on education, college, finance, and retirement out there. Avail yourself of what interests you, but don’t let it overwhelm you to the point that you act rashly… or don’t act at all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stocks rebounded in the final days of October, softening what was otherwise a rough month. </p>
<p>Optimism for a potential trade breakthrough between the US and China at the G20 meeting later this month helped fuel gains. International shares fared best. Corporate earnings continue to be mostly good, but not as universally positive as we’ve seen the last two quarters. On Thursday, Apple issued disappointing guidance for holiday sales and shares fell 7%. </p>
<h2>Weekly Returns</h2>
<p>S&#038;P 500: 2,723 (+2.4%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US (VEU): (+3.5%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 3.22% (+0.13)<br />
Gold: $1,233 (-0.2%)<br />
EUR/USD: $1.139 (-0.1%)</p>
<h2>Major Event</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monday</strong> – A Lion Air Boeing 737 crashed outside of Jakarta.</li>
<li><strong>Monday</strong> – Tech stocks continued to decline, with Amazon and Netflix hitting down 20%, approaching “bear market” territory.</li>
<li><strong>Tuesday</strong> – New GE CEO Larry Culp slashed the dividend to one cent and said the company would significantly miss profit targets for the year.</li>
<li><strong>Tuesday</strong> – President Trump said he wishes to end automatic right to citizenship to those born in the US.</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday</strong> – GM issued surprisingly strong Q3 results and also announced it is offering buyouts to 18,000 salaried employees.</li>
<li><strong>Thursday</strong> – The Justice Department charted two ex-Goldman Sachs bankers in connection to the Malaysian 1MDB scandal.</li>
<li><strong>Thursday</strong> – Apple posted strong revenues and earnings but issued softer guidance and announced it will stop reporting unit sales volumes for iPhones.</li>
<li><strong>Friday</strong> – The US added 250,000 jobs and unemployment remained at 3.7%, the lowest since 1969.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Two positive days to end October were welcome after market losses seemed to be accelerating early in the week. In the US, declines appeared out of nowhere and have been sharp and steep after a recent all-time high. It has been difficult to pinpoint a specific cause. Typically, that behavior is more characteristic of a correction than something that evolves into a full-fledged bear market. </p>
<p>However, the global market tells a different story. With international stocks (VEU) down 9% for the year, the global market has remained below its highs from January and has seen a flattish or down trend since. </p>
<p>None of this can tell us with any certainty where the market is headed, but it suggests investors should be prepared for all outcomes. That is true in terms of high level asset allocation and also how diversified one’s stock portfolio is. The tech darlings took a beating this month. That may turn out to be a blip, but there could still be a long way to fall for the leaders of this bull market if a real bear shows up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Midterm elections are coming up in less than a week, and due to the major implications that the midterms can have on fiscal policy, many investors are asking: what effect will the elections have on the market?</p>
<p>With the return of market volatility in October, lingering trade war concerns, relations with China, and interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, Wall Street is keeping a close eye on Washington.</p>
<p>Lead-ups to elections cause uncertainty, something that tends to cause a spike in volatility, but we have also seen that markets tend to rally post-midterms.</p>
<h2>What Are We Expecting From the Election?</h2>
<p>As for the election itself, Democrats are hoping a “blue wave” will push them into control of Republican-led Congress, but it’s starting to look like it may be an uphill battle to do so. If Republicans stay in Congress, it may buoy President Donald Trump to more aggressively pursue items on his political agenda, which may include more tax reform. If the Democrats gain control of Congress, Trump’s policy goals will likely be suppressed.</p>
<p>In the Senate, there are 35 seats up for grabs, but only 9 are currently held by Republicans. In the House of Representatives, of course, each representative must be elected every two years. Democrats would need to gain 24 additional seats for a majority. This is a tall order, but a record 39 Republicans are not running for reelection.</p>
<p>Especially in the wake of the Kavanaugh controversy, the outcome is impossible to predict. Many analysts are preparing for a split Congress. However, we always have to be prepared for changes in sentiment – Trump was losing in the polls prior to his surprise presidential election victory in 2016. If we do end up with a divided Congress, it would likely mean more gridlock and less legislative action. This may prove a constructive environment for stocks, which tend to enjoy the relative certainty of less rule changes.</p>
<p>So how have midterms impacted the stock market in the past, and what do we recommend for investors during this politically uncertain time?</p>
<h2>Market Volatility and the Midterm Elections</h2>
<p>Recent market volatility has spooked many investors, but it is worth noting that choppiness just before midterm elections is common, and the calendar year following has historically been very strong, posting an average return of approximately 18% since the 1930s.</p>
<p>While we have no idea how the elections will shake out, we do know that markets don’t respond well to uncertainty, so the relative volatility in the buildup to the elections is not particularly unexpected. Post-election, even if the result is not what pundits and pollsters were anticipating, the market has historically responded with an upswing. For the markets, any resolution is better than uncertainty. This year has been a bit of an anomaly, with a rapid melt-up in January followed by a quick correction in February, but a familiar October, bearing resemblance to the last midterm-October market performance in 2014 where markets followed a V-shape, rallying higher into the end of the year.</p>
<p>But remember: history is only a guide, not a predictor of the future.</p>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Take any projections &#8212; whether about the outcome of the election or their impact on the markets &#8212; with a grain of salt. Nobody, including us, has a crystal ball &#8212; we don’t know for sure what will happen with the midterms and what impact they will have on the market. Don’t be surprised if you see the market rally in the coming weeks, but don’t get complacent either.</p>
<p>Regardless of what happens in the midterm elections, we recommend that instead of worrying about their impact on the market, investors should focus on developing and sticking to a long-term, well-diversified investing strategy. Remaining disciplined in a diversified strategy should help you better weather any market swings from political uncertainty, as well as other outside influences. Adhering to a long-term plan and rebalancing are some of the best ways to ensure you’re in a good spot, regardless of what the market does and when.</p>
<p>Instead of worrying about the elections this week, focus on what you can control to strengthen your financial plan. Invest in yourself this year &#8211; focus on important year-end financial planning like revisiting your regimented savings strategy and getting started on your end-of-year tax planning.</p>
<p>If you have any additional questions, contact a financial advisor.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people think that equity compensation is automatically equal to a windfall – the next Facebook or Instagram story.</p>
<p>But the truth is, this is usually not the case for the majority of us. Equity can be a great form of compensation, since it aligns incentives between employees and employers and enables employees to build long-term wealth. However, while equity compensation may provide significant upsides, beware: it can create complications relative to cash compensation. That’s why it is so important to understand what kind of equity you are being offered and how much to see how it impacts your overall net worth and future financial plans.</p>

<h2>Ask These Questions When Discussing Equity Compensation with Your Employer (or Potential Employer)</h2>
<p><code><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dq4p2PMhGsc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></code></p>
<h2>Who Is Offered Equity Compensation?</h2>
<p>Equity compensation is applicable in both the startup and corporate worlds. But the scenarios are not all equal, and not all recipients find themselves on a path to riches, contrary to popular perception. The extent to which you will benefit from an equity compensation package depends not only upon the performance of the stock, but also on how well you manage key decisions relating to your equity. In particular, understanding the type of equity you have and the associated tax implications is critical to your success – as is understanding the risk of investing in an individual stock versus a diversified portfolio.</p>
<p>The first step to making sense of your equity compensation package and its impact on your overall financial picture is asking clarifying questions about the offer before you accept the package. It&#8217;s important to fully understand what you are being offered and how it will affect you before you sign on the dotted line.</p>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>When it comes to employee equity compensation, you’re oftentimes putting yourself into a speculative position.</p>
<p>Sure, you have the chance of potentially coming into a big windfall, but keep in mind that you’re also placing a bet that the employer who signs your paycheck is going to be successful.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s important to understand what awards you are being offered, what the vesting schedule is in your situation, and what tax consequences you might have so you aren’t unnecessarily overpaying, while also managing concentration risk within your overall allocation. Also, you should understand that while taxes are an important aspect to consider, they should not be the underlying reason a diversification strategy isn’t implemented.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With news of the massive Mega Millions lottery prize going to a lucky winner in South Carolina last week, it’s a perfect time to discuss how to handle a windfall.</p>
<p>While most of us will never be lottery winners, there are much more common “windfall scenarios” that can have a major impact on your net worth such as inheritance, receiving a life insurance payout, selling a valuable asset like real estate, or cashing in on your employee equity.</p>
<h1>Here are some general guidelines for how to deal with a large windfall:</h1>
<h2>Secure the funds and don’t do anything immediately.</h2>
<p>Upon receiving a large and unexpected sum of money, many people’s natural instinct is to act immediately to make purchases, investments, or use the money in other ways. Before you decide what to do with your windfall, park your money somewhere secure and speak with your family members and your financial advisor. Taking your time and working closely with unbiased financial professionals will help you ensure that your money is being used most effectively, and can help support your long-term financial planning objectives and personal goals. That said, sitting in cash for any length of time is inefficient, so work to put a strategy in place within a couple months of the windfall.</p>
<h2>Make sure your <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/legacy-estate-planning/5-key-estate-planning-documents/">estate plan</a> is in order.</h2>
<p>We recommend that people review their estate plans on a consistent basis, and anytime a significant life event happens. Some windfalls will dramatically change the size and nature of your estate, so it’s important to make sure this change is reflected in your plan. We recommend working with an estate planning attorney to ensure that your affairs are in order, especially if your estate suddenly and significantly changes. If you don’t need the money from your windfall, you might consider disclaiming it so it can pass to your heirs without being subject to estate taxes.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-48142 aligncenter" src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/5-key-estate-planning-documents-300x134.jpg" alt="5 key estate planning documents" width="600" height="268" srcset="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/5-key-estate-planning-documents-300x134.jpg 300w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/5-key-estate-planning-documents-768x342.jpg 768w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/5-key-estate-planning-documents-952x424.jpg 952w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/5-key-estate-planning-documents-1080x481.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2>Understand the tax implications and work with a tax professional.</h2>
<p>You will likely need to pay taxes on your windfall &#8212; but how much depends on the source of the money. If your windfall was from certain sources like an inheritance, gift, or a life insurance payout, you will generally avoid federal income tax (<a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/taxes-insurance/wealth-transfer-strategies/">here is additional information</a> on tax reform&#8217;s impact on estate taxes). Funds from sources like lottery winnings or receiving a large bonus are generally taxed at your ordinary federal income tax rate. Income from the sale of real estate or a business, for example, will generally be taxed as long-term capital gains. Keep in mind that you may well owe additional state income taxes on your windfall as well depending on the state you live in and the circumstance of your windfall. How you are taxed greatly depends on how you came into the money, and a tax professional can help you tease out what taxes you owe and how much, as well as advise you on the best use of your newfound funds for optimal tax treatment. Ideally, coordinating with both a tax and estate specialist is key, as some estate objectives (like a charitable donation) may impact your tax picture.</p>
<h2>Reevaluate your investment portfolio.</h2>
<p>Pre-windfall, your portfolio might have been mostly focused on growth to build wealth. However, if your windfall allows you to re-think this approach, you might want to explore an <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management/investment-strategy">investment strategy</a> that is focused on protecting your wealth. This might mean significantly re-thinking your asset allocation to optimize your portfolio for wealth preservation and minimizing the impact of future taxes.</p>
<h2>Once you’ve ticked these basic financial planning boxes, here are some additional possibilities you might consider when starting to think about how to use your windfall money:</h2>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pay off high-interest debt.</strong> Paying off high-interest debt (like credit card debt) is something you should take care of with your windfall money first, before you even think of splurging or making a big purchase. Talk to your financial advisor about how to deal with other kinds of debt like your mortgage or student loans.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Charitable giving.</strong> Share the wealth! Donating to charitable organizations allows you to both make a difference with your windfall money and <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/taxes-insurance/obtain-tax-benefits-with-charitable-giving/">reap tax benefits</a>. There are several different ways you can give &#8212; contact a financial advisor for advice on the best way for you to do so.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Think about what insurance you might need.</strong> You may no longer need life insurance money if your estate is large enough to support your family after a windfall, but you may want to consider other types of insurance such as a personal extra liability or umbrella policy.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Set up an emergency fund. </strong>If you don&#8217;t already have one, putting around 3-6 months of living expenses in a high yield savings account is generally advisable.</li>
<p>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Once you’ve taken care of how to manage your windfall and taken care of high-priority expenses like high-interest debt &#8212; enjoy yourself! Take that vacation you’ve always dreamed of, start the business you’ve always had in the back of your mind, or buy a new car. Having a team of unbiased financial professionals who are fiduciaries for your money will help you deal with the big practicalities up front so you can enjoy the comfort and freedom that a large windfall can often afford.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Volatility remained in the global markets this week. Relatively substantial drops in the major US equity indices occurred Wednesday, only to see those same indices rebound significantly the next day on Thursday, with Friday seeing the S&#038;P 500, the DOW, and the NASDAQ all closing lower for the week. </p>
<p>The driving forces behind this week’s volatility seem to be the same that we’ve commented throughout this year: fears of escalating trade issues between the US and China, concerns around rising interest rates in the United States, and said impact on company earnings and general economic growth. </p>
<p>Some big tech names such as Amazon and Alphabet underwhelmed investors with earning reports that while positive, were not as positive as expected. Other names such as Tesla, surprised to the upside. </p>
<h2>Weekly Returns:</h2>
<p>S&#038;P 500: 2659 (-3.9%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US(VEU): (-3.5%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 3.08% (-3.81%)<br />
Gold: $1236 (0.7%)<br />
EUR/USD: 1.14 (-0.9%)</p>
<h2>Major Events</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monday – News reports focused on thousands of Honduran migrants who are passing through Mexico with the intent to enter the United States.</li>
<li>Monday – Tesla announced that it would be releasing its 3rd Quarter results more than a week early. Results were good, and Tesla closed up over 25% on Friday from Monday’s close.</li>
<li>Tuesday – Caterpillar and 3M, two major industrial companies, saw their shares trade lower on earnings reports that listed concerns such as a more expensive US dollar (relative to foreign currencies) and declining demand in China.</li>
<li>Tuesday – President Trump was interviewed by the Wall Street Journal, and much of the reporting surrounded his critique of the Federal Reserve’s interest rates hikes. Presidents over the past several decades have typically avoided commenting on Federal Reserve actions.</li>
<li>Wednesday – US major market indices declined significantly, with technology stocks driving much of the declines.</li>
<li>Thursday – US major market indices rebounded from Wednesday’s drop-off.</li>
<li>Thursday – Amazon reports a profit for its Q3 earnings, but revenues were not as strong as hoped, with Amazon indicating that the holiday season could see slower growth. As one of the first $1 trillion companies, recent results beg the question of how long Amazon will be able to maintain its gorilla status. <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/q3-2018-market-review-outlook-report-sector-shakeups-and-strong-earnings/">Our Q3 Report</a> speaks about the difficulty of staying a top contender for long.</li>
<li>Friday – Major US equity market indices closed down over 1-2% from Thursday’s rebound, ending the week in the red.</li>
<li>Friday – As of Friday morning, one individual was taken into custody by law enforcement officials, related to the recent string of mail bombs sent to prominent individuals affiliated with the Democratic party. The number of discovered mailed bombs increased from 10 to 13 as of Friday as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Occasionally, writing these pieces can be an exercise in finding something engaging for readers. This week was not one of those weeks. With continual releases around Saudi Reporter Jamal Khashoggi’s death in a Saudi consulate in Turkey, a rollercoaster of emotions during this week’s market fluctuations, and an impending election cycle across the United States, there is a lot happening. </p>
<p>Of course, the follow up question many of you might have (and which I certainly hear from friends and acquaintances outside of work) is some form of the question “what does that mean for the markets, and what should I do about it?”</p>
<p>Many times, I wonder how my answers are perceived. The truth is, it’s impossible to tell exactly what will move the markets or how. I suspect people may not like my answers because it’s natural for us to want specific, concise, and easy to understand answers to our questions: “Boil it down for me so I can take action!” Yet I fear that my answer to the question of “how do I react to what’s happening in the markets?” may instill a similar reaction to someone stating that they enjoy eating lemons raw: “try not to react at all.” </p>
<p>Granted, I don’t know who you are and what your situation is, reader, but I can tell you that the vast majority of the time, reacting is exactly what you should avoid doing. </p>
<p>That said, reacting is different from ‘doing something.’ Here are a few thoughts on what you can focus on to help better position yourself for whatever the markets give us over the coming months and years:   </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start from a point of strength.</strong> Specifically, be diversified. If you’re in the right portfolio to begin with, you’ll feel less need to react. Said differently: avoid putting yourself in a position in which you feel a strong need to react. This can not only help you sleep at night, but it also improves your chances of long-term financial success.</li>
<li><strong>Keep things in context</strong>. Over the past 100 years, there have been good market periods and bad market periods. Overall, markets have expanded, and investors have been richly rewarded. There will always be concerns and fears about what will happen next, and there will be bear markets in the future. Those who expect otherwise will be disappointed and may react as a result of their disappointment. When investing, always remember that nothing is guaranteed.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on what you can control.</strong> Rather than trying to make your portfolio do exactly what you want every day, take other steps to make your financial goals achievable. How much you save today, when you retire, and what you spend in retirement are all relatively controllable items you can take action on. More granularly, make sure you are tax efficient in your investing, and that you’re methodically rebalancing. As a general rule of thumb, avoid any decisions that are being made based on a ‘gut feeling.’ </li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management">Talk to someone.</a></strong> Finances are an emotionally charged subject. A good financial advisor acts not just as a knowledgeable resource but as someone who understands how critical the emotional aspect of investing is. Being an advisor is half financial know-how and half being a great listener. Investors are less likely to make emotion-based decisions when they have someone to talk through things with. Having an advisor to talk to is a value that can be hard to quantify, but anecdotally I’ve lost count of the number of clients I’ve helped avoid reacting to the latest fear, only to have them come back and thank me later.</li>
<li><strong>Take a break.</strong> If all else fails, take a bit of a break from watching the rollercoaster. Give yourself some time away to just let the markets do what they’re going to do. Naturally, this works better if you’re not directly managing your own finances.</li>
</ol>
<p>All this is to say – Personal Capital has been talking about the importance of a balanced, diversified strategy for some time now, and this week was a great example of why diversification matters. We hope everyone has a safe and enjoyable weekend. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was another wild week for markets. A strong relief rally on Tuesday helped push global stocks into positive territory, only to be partially offset by steep declines Thursday. </p>
<p>Losses continue to be driven by ongoing fears surrounding trade and interest rates, which accelerated on news Steven Mnuchin would not participate in Saudi Arabia’s upcoming investor summit. Despite this, the S&#038;P 500 was still able to lock in a small gain for the week, while foreign stocks ended down. Outside of gold and real estate, most other asset classes posted weekly declines, including bonds.   </p>
<h2>Weekly Returns</h2>
<p>S&#038;P 500: 2,769 (+0.1%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US (VEU): (-0.5%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 3.20% (+0.05%)<br />
Gold: $1,227 (+0.4%)<br />
EUR/USD: $1.151 (-0.4%)</p>
<h2>Major Events:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monday – With less than 700 stores nationwide, Sears officially filed for bankruptcy after years of struggles.</li>
<li>Monday – Bank of America reported better-than-expected results, with earnings increasing 32% on higher interest rates and a continued lift from the corporate tax cuts.</li>
<li>Tuesday – President Trump publicly criticized the Fed’s interest rate policy, calling the central bank his “biggest threat”.</li>
<li>Thursday – One of Afghanistan’s most prominent police chiefs was killed in a Taliban attack, which narrowly missed the top US commander in the country.</li>
<li>Thursday – Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin cancelled his planned participation at a summit in Saudi Arabia in response to the suspected killing of a prominent journalist by the Saudi government.</li>
<li>Friday – Facebook announced that it hired Nick Clegg, Britain’s former deputy prime minister, as its top policy and communications executive.</li>
<li>Friday – US existing home sales came in weaker than expected, posting the sixth straight monthly drop.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Today, we essentially hit the one month mark from the market top on September 20th. Since then, it’s been a pretty volatile ride, but it’s certainly been interesting to watch performance both before and after the top. Growth previously led value, but recently, the peak value is leading. Small cap previously led large, but now large is ahead. Discretionary was the top performing sector, now it’s Utilities. </p>
<p>A lot of this makes sense as categories that go up the most tend to come down the most during pullbacks. However, it also goes to show how difficult it is to predict winning categories. Any guesses on the top performing sector for the full year? It’s not Tech or Discretionary—it’s actually Health Care. And who would have thought boring old Utilities would be one of the top five sectors year to date? </p>
<p>In fact, if you had to guess what sector performed best over the last 20 years, Tech or Utilities, which would you choose? Most of you probably assumed this is a trick question and guessed Utilities, right? Well if so, you’d be correct! From December 31st, 1998 through yesterday (10/18), the Utilities sector (represented by XLU) is up more than 250%, compared to Technology which is up close to 170% (represented by XLK). That’s huge.</p>
<p>Of course some might consider this cherry picking since Technology had a severe downturn in the early 2000s, but it’s all relative. This would have made a very REAL difference for someone investing in the late 1990’s. By 1999, the Technology sector made up roughly 29% of the S&#038;P 500. This compares to a mere ~2% weight for Utilities. So even if someone bought a “diversified” S&#038;P 500 fund, they would have invested more than 13x of their money in the underperforming sector. </p>
<p>The truth, however, is that it was actually a lot worse for many people. No one in 1998 wanted to sit idly and watch their friends get rich on hot stocks, so they placed even bigger concentrated bets on Tech. You would have been called crazy had you told your friends Utilities are where it’s at. And for a while you would have actually looked crazy. But we all know what happened next. </p>
<p>How does this relate to today? Well, we don’t think we’re in a massive Technology bubble like the late 1990s, but it’s certainly becoming a concentrated bet for many investors. Before the recent GICS changes, the Technology sector had grown to more than a quarter of the S&#038;P 500. That’s a big weight. </p>
<p>Moreover, we see a lot of people piling into the same crowded trades, like the FAANG stocks. Out of the many free users of our Financial Dashboard, more than 30% of them with at least $100,000 in assets had direct exposure to some or all of the FAANG stocks. And those stocks by themselves represented, on average, 16% of these users US equity exposure. That compares to about 10% for a broader market index fund, like VTI. In other words, their exposure is 60% higher than the broader market! And for users with less than $100,000 in assets, the concentration was even greater. </p>
<p>What does all this mean? Simply put, no one can predict exactly what category will perform best. And if we know that’s the case, why allocate an outsized portion of your net worth to a single sector? As recent volatility has shown, these trends can reverse in a heartbeat. We’re not saying investors should dump Tech stocks—they should absolutely be an integral part of any well-diversified portfolio. But they should be owned in moderation and on more equal footing with all of the other sectors. After all, do you really know which one will outperform over the next 20 years? </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve recently experienced a sudden reappearance of big down days and also some big up days, and while it’s natural to try to find what is to blame, volatility often has no obvious cause, even when looking at it in the rearview mirror.</p>
<p>While it’s difficult to pinpoint what exactly causes volatility, the sell-off last week could likely be contributed to two speeches from two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The first speech showcase Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who said that rates are still a long way from “neutral,” and that we are likely to go past it (“neutral” is usually thought of being somewhere around the 3-3.5% range). Keep in mind, the Fed has for nearly a decade found ways to be more accommodative, and it is likely that short rates will continue to rise unless economic data changes course significantly.</p>
<p>The second speech was delivered by Vice President Pence on China. It focused on Chinese election meddling, aggression, and unwanted behavior. Pence noted the ongoing – if not escalating – tensions between the United States and China, so trade conflict and tariffs are not only likely to go away soon, but could also intensify.</p>
<p>On the other side of rising rates and trade conflict, however, we’ve seen phenomenal earnings growth over the past few quarters. Big boosts and support for companies have come through tax cuts and keeping wage growth low, driving margins to the highest in decades.</p>
<p><code><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P_R_lh9lXwI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></code></p>
<p>The reality is, there have been six similar pullbacks in the last seven years – and each rebounded relatively quickly. This is why panic or knee-jerk reactions to market events like this are rarely good for your financial strategy. While the current bull market is the longest ever by some measures, eventually it will end. The interest rate environment and trade conflict have become bigger headwinds, and globally, the market has lost positive momentum.</p>
<p>This month’s pullback saw tech and other high momentum stocks hardest hit. Keep in mind, it’s not unusual for what sees the most success fall fastest when markets decline.  This is why diversification is so important – and a more diversified approach to U.S. stocks weathers the down days better. And of course, diversification at the asset class level helps even more.</p>
<p>It’s too soon to say that there is a true shift away from tech and momentum leadership. But eventually, as it always has, leadership will rotate. We can’t know if it’s happening next year or beyond – or if it’s already happened. Because of this, remaining diversified and rebalancing (which creates benefit from actual math, and not just guesses) are some of the best ways to ensure you’re in a good spot, regardless of what the market does and when.</p>

					<h4><strong>Life is full of uncertainties. We protect our families with life insurance and our cars and homes with auto and homeowner policies. But how do we protect our financial futures? </strong></h4>
<p>Even during times of relative stability in the financial markets, having a long-term financial plan in place that is built to weather the unknowns is a smart move to make. The market is, after all, rarely driven by just one factor – that’s why it’s so hard to time the ups and downs. Investors with a strategic plan can feel more confident about their finances and don’t have to worry about outguessing factors beyond their control.</p>
<p>There’s a saying: “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” The <em>Personal Capital Investor’s Guide to Volatile Markets</em> is designed to help you prepare for – or react to – what the market might throw at you. Like many things in life, luck and timing play a big role in your financial success. These factors may be beyond your control, but regardless of how they play out, it’s up to you to exercise control where you can. With a long-term plan and clear goals in place, we believe that you can navigate your way through the up and down times to achieve your financial goals.</p>
<p>We will cover <strong>6 costly mistakes</strong> that investors can often experience in a volatile market, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emotional decision-making</li>
<li>Recency bias</li>
<li>Failure to define risk</li>
<li>Failure to understand investment risk</li>
<li>Trying to time the market</li>
<li>Insufficient diversification</li>
<li>&#8230;and more!</li>
</ul>

					<p class="yellow-text"><span style="color: #000000;">Before you get started on a long-term financial plan, it can be helpful to understand some of the underlying components that can make a plan successful regardless of where the market goes. </span></p>
<p class="yellow-text"><span style="color: #000000;">While this is by no means a comprehensive list, it’s important to recognize these variables and the impact they can have on you and your investments.</span></p>
<h3>EMOTIONS</h3>
<p>Staying focused on a long-term plan with clear goals is the best way to navigate what can sometimes be an emotional roller coaster. Emotions are neither good nor bad; however, they cannot be avoided, and are often heightened when money and life savings come into play. It’s natural to have an emotional reaction to money and volatility, but making decisions based on can negatively impact an investor’s financial future. Markets can be volatile over short or long periods of time. Although we don’t know for sure what the next day will bring, how we react to volatility is what we as investors can control.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our brains are wired to want to chase results and make emotional decisions. We know we are supposed to buy low and sell high, but we’d rather buy into the hot investment (buying high) and then sell it when it doesn’t work out (selling low). That’s why the average investor will <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4108688-investor-returns-vs-market-returns-failure-endures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistently underperform a basic market index</a>.</p>

<p>A great way to better manage emotional reactions when it comes to your finances is to know where you’re going.

Just as importantly, it will help keep the focus on the long-term path to your financial goals, which leads to better decision-making.

					<h3>RECENCY BIAS</h3>
<p>The problem with investing starts with our natural inclination to want to own what has done well recently.</p>
<p>It makes for a good story at the cocktail party to say we made a big bet on the “latest and greatest” investment. This effect is common enough that it has its own name: recency bias. Recency bias is the tendency to think that trends and patterns in the recent past will continue in the future, which then impacts certain conclusions, decisions or behaviors.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170301006175/en/New-DC-Pulse-Survey-BlackRock-Employees%E2%80%99-Retirement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to a BlackRock survey</a> of retirement plan participants, 66% of surveyed workers believe that over the next decade, returns on their savings will continue to be in line with what they have experienced in the past, while 17% believe they will experience even higher returns. This shows how this type of bias can be particularly dangerous during periods of rising markets because it can grow stronger as the market reaches higher peaks. For example, a lengthy bull market can lull us into a false sense of security, which can translate into trouble – how do you think asset bubbles are created?</p>
<p>Recency bias works the opposite way, too, when you experience negative events. In 2008, the economy was teetering on the precipice and the stock market crashed. Many investors quickly determined that these negative events would continue, and they liquidated their investment portfolios. When the financial markets rebounded, many of those same investors realized their error and jumped back into the markets. Unfortunately, they locked in their losses and bought back in after much of the recovery had already happened. Recency bias cost those investors a lot.</p>

<li>Determine how much time you have to save to reach your goals</li>

					<h3>RISK TOLERANCE &amp; RISK AVERSION</h3>
<p>Risk tolerance is critical to constructing an appropriate portfolio for each individual, but the industry in general does a poor job of using it.</p>
<p>The first problem is a lack of standard definitions. Being “aggressive” or “moderate” or an “eight out of 10” can mean very different things to different people. A second major problem associated with risk tolerance is inappropriate application of it. Your willingness to take risk is only part of the equation. Your objectives for taking risk are just as important as your stomach for it.</p>
<p>The key is finding the right combination of need, desire, ability, and willingness to take risk. The step after identifying your risk tolerance is designing a portfolio that properly utilizes it – and that you will stick with. A mismatch between stated risk tolerance and portfolio design can be quite common among investors.</p>
<p>It’s good to keep in mind that higher returns come with higher risk, but on the other hand, being too conservative over time can be just as big of a mistake as taking too much risk.</p>

					<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>PERSONAL CAPITAL STRATEGY: DEFINING RISK TOLERANCE</strong></h3>
<p>In designing financial strategies for our clients, we’ve been careful to define risk levels using both risk tolerance and objectives. Using standard language helps us stay consistent. Here are some helpful ways to define various levels of risk tolerance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Highest Safety</strong> – Market volatility makes very uncomfortable. Safety is a much higher priority than growth for me, and I do not expect growth meaningfully above inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Conservative</strong> – I am able to accept some volatility, but have difficulty stomaching meaningful fluctuations in account values. I expect long-term growth somewhat above inflation, but am willing to sacrifice up to half of my potential long-term return in exchange for less volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Moderate</strong> – I am comfortable with moderate volatility consistent with a diversified portfolio which includes a significant allocation to stocks. I prefer to sacrifice some long-term return in order to reduce risk.</li>
<li><strong>Aggressive</strong> – My primary objective is to achieve growth, and I am comfortable with typical stock market volatility. Still, I am willing to trade a small amount of growth potential to reduce risk.</li>
<li><strong>Highest Growth</strong> – I am willing to take a high degree of risk in pursuit of higher returns, and am very comfortable with the volatility of a 100% stock portfolio.</li>

					<h3>TIMING THE MARKET: A MYTH</h3>
<p>Market timing and stock picking are like going to Las Vegas.</p>
<p>You might win, but most likely, you will lose. If you go every year, it is nearly guaranteed you will end up losing overall. The difference is you are betting big chunks of your net worth. (And you’re not even getting free drinks.)</p>
<p>The trouble with market timing is that in order to win, you must correctly predict market cycles. First, you must predict when to sell an asset class. Now? Next week? The end of the year? You don’t have a crystal ball, so you can’t possibly know the correct answer.</p>
<p>Even if you do correctly guess when to sell, you’re not free from the market-timing trap. In fact, you’re just halfway there. Now, you must figure out when to get back in. If the market drops 600 points in a day, will you dive back in? Will you wait for a full week of falling returns or a terrible month of returns? What if you wait for a bad month, buy back in and the market continues to fall? Will you bail again?</p>
<p>And if you are lucky enough to have successfully timed both sides of the market, did you really make any money? That depends on the size of your gains and the cost of trading in and out of the market. If your gains are relatively modest, trading costs may eat up most of your profits.</p>

					<h2><strong>Diversification as a Safeguard</strong></h2>
				</div>
			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_66 et_pb_bg_layout_light  et_pb_text_align_left">

					<p><span style="color: #000000;">As we’ve mentioned, if you’re thinking about the long haul, predicting the market is never effective.</span></p>
<p>What is one of the strongest safeguards against market volatility? One word: diversification. We believe that a properly diversified portfolio prepares you for whatever may happen. After all, who knows what the future will bring?</p>
<h3>WHAT IS DIVERSIFICATION?</h3>
<p>We know we need to diversify, but what does that really mean? It means owning a variety of asset classes, including those that are out of favor. It means buying some more of these asset classes when they don’t do well. Sometimes today’s “must-have” is tomorrow’s “has-been.”</p>
<p>In other words, a properly diversified portfolio has assets that have a negative correlation – when one part of the portfolio goes up another tends to go down. If everything in your portfolio is going up, you’re not diversified. How else can you buy low and sell high if nothing’s down when something else is up? It’s no fun watching parts of your portfolio going down, but having the discipline to rebalance to the proper diversification with your long-term goals in mind will help drive long-term results.</p>
<h3>HOW TO DIVERSIFY</h3>
<p>Diversification is achieved by owning multiple asset classes and securities with a positive expected return and low or negative correlations. Simply put: their values tend to move in opposite directions relative to one another in response to market events. It is also important to diversify at the sub-asset-class level.</p>
<p>Size, style, sector, and industry are important factors. It’s generally good to aim for a well-balanced mix within each. Diversification is also important within bond holdings: the issuer, duration, and credit quality are key factors. Inflation-protected bonds provide important diversification, helping shield returns against rising prices.</p>
<p>Once constructed, a properly diversified portfolio must be maintained. Periodic rebalancing ensures that the portfolio remains consistent with its original goals. It can also boost returns by reducing volatility resulting from sector and style bubbles.</p>

					<p><span style="color: #000000;">Market volatility can be a roller coaster – it can scare the best of us.</span></p>
<p>But detaching these emotions from investment decisions is one of the hardest psychological biases to overcome. What can you do to better prepare for the future and handle volatility during a financially and emotionally turbulent time? A few tips can help protect your portfolio from one of its biggest enemies: your emotions.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_toggle et_pb_module et_pb_accordion_item et_pb_accordion_item_6  et_pb_toggle_open">


				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">1. Consider hiring an advisor</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					 If you have a tough time separating emotion from your decision-making, remove the need to make decisions altogether. This is one of the biggest benefits of having your investments professionally managed. An advisor (preferably a fee-based RIA) can objectively evaluate your financial goals and recommend a long-term strategy best suited to getting you there. And if you still get scared from time to time, you have a voice of reason just a phone call away.

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">2. Periodically rebalance</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					 Disciplined rebalancing is one of the most important components of a successful long-term strategy. It ensures you’re constantly buying low and selling high. Again, this is something an advisor can help with. It can be emotionally difficult to sell some of your best performers and buy your worst performers, but over time it works. And market volatility can create some valuable rebalancing opportunities.

			</div> <!-- .et_pb_toggle --><div class="et_pb_toggle et_pb_module et_pb_accordion_item et_pb_accordion_item_8  et_pb_toggle_close">


				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">3. Stick to your long-term plan</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					 It’s okay to be opportunistic in a down market – you can use it as a rebalancing opportunity, or even a chance to pare back concentrated positions. But you should avoid drastic changes to your long-term strategic portfolio allocation (e.g., selling everything and sitting in cash). A proper allocation should accommodate both down and up markets. For successful long-term financial planning, it is critical to understand what you’ve got, how much you make, what you owe, how you spend, and how you are investing for the future. If you have a solid foundation, then a thorough assessment of your position will make that abundantly clear. If you face serious challenges, clearly understanding them will empower you to make adjustments and significantly improve your situation and financial future.

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">4. Know your asset allocation</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					 Asset allocation refers to your portfolio’s relative exposure to the major types of liquid investments. In other words, how much of your money do you put in stocks, bonds, cash, and alternatives? Successful asset allocation strategy balances your need, ability, and willingness to take risk. It should be based on your expected cash flows and be designed to maximize the odds of achieving your retirement spending goals. It is widely accepted that asset allocation is probably the most important factor in successful investing.

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">5. Ensure proper diversification</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					 At the end of the day, no matter how aggressive you want to be, putting all your eggs into the proverbial basket is too risky. When we see markets go down, the most important component is recovery. How quickly can you recover from that type of market shift? If you have even a couple components in your portfolio that are going up while the majority goes down, then you’re shaving off time between recovery and growth. Owning things that may not look as attractive in today’s market could become the stepping-stone toward actual growth in future markets.

					<p><span style="color: #000000;">When it comes to weathering market volatility, one important first step is being familiar with what your portfolio actually looks like.</span></p>
<p>So how do you know if you’re where you should be in terms of your portfolio? Here are some good questions you should ask yourself – or your advisor – to see if your investments can weather the storm, today and in the future.</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">1. At what stage of life am I?</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					 Much of your financial strategy is predicated on where you are in life and where you want to be in the future. Are you married? Do you have kids? Is paying for your kids’ college or perhaps retiring at a certain age one of your long-term goals? If so, you may want to consider how much risk you can afford to take, and how much volatility you can withstand while still reaching those goals.

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">2. How much time do I have to dedicate to my financial plan?</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					 There’s no doubt that successful financial planning takes ongoing effort, time, and energy. Think about your busy life, and evaluate how much effort you want to put into this. Can you do the legwork to research 80-plus stocks, and do you have the resources and the knowledge to do so?

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">3. What is my target asset allocation, and is my portfolio in line?</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					 An asset allocation is a portfolio’s percentage mix of stocks, bonds, alternatives, and cash – essentially all of the liquid asset classes. The precise mix should be tailored to your specific financial situation, risk tolerance and goals. It is probably the most important driver of long-term total returns, so it’s a decision you want to get right.

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">4. Does my portfolio contain any concentration risks?</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					 Concentration risks are large overweights to any one area of the market. These can include one or more economic sectors, sizes, styles, or individual stocks, among other things. They can be intentional market bets or occur unintentionally from owning cap-weighted index funds or failing to rebalance back to target weights over time. Regardless, they can present significant risk to portfolio returns, particularly if they’re in the form of single stock positions.

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">5. How do I deal with a rapidly falling market?</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					 There is a considerable amount of factors at play when investors are confronted with a volatile market. From internal to external forces, your reaction to market volatility can drastically impact your whole life. So, ask yourself: how do you know when to get out of the market? And how do you know when to get back in – and how do you determine what to get back into? What is your previous track record of going to cash? And while you may think you have a solid plan in place, do you have any previous examples of executing on this?

<p><code><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ToyumuthFPE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></code></p>
<p>Stock options are probably the most well-known form of equity compensation.</p>
<p>A stock option is the right to buy a specific number of shares of company stock at a pre-set price, known as the “exercise” or “strike price,” for a fixed period of time, usually following a predetermined waiting period, called the “vesting period.” Most vesting periods span follow three to five years, with a certain percentage of options vesting (which means you’ve “earned” your shares, though you still need to exercise (i.e., purchase them).</p>
<p>When it comes to options, one of their biggest advantages is leverage. With more options per grant relative to other forms of equity compensation, there is significant upside potential But despite the upside, these don’t come without risk.</p>
<p>Stock options are commonly used to attract prospective employees and to retain current employees.</p>
<p>The incentive of stock options to a prospective employee is the possibility of owning stock of the company at a discounted rate compared to buying the stock on the open market.</p>
<p>The retention of employees who have been granted stock options occurs through a technique called vesting. Vesting helps employers encourage employees to stay through the vesting period to obtain the shares granted to them. Your options don’t belong to you until you have met the requirements of the vesting schedule.</p>
<p>For example, assume you have been granted 10,000 shares with a four-year vesting schedule at 2,500 shares at the end of each year. This means you have to stay for at least one full year in order to exercise the first 2,500 shares and must stay to the end of the fourth year to be able to exercise all 10,000 shares. In order to receive your full grant, you will likely have to stay with your company the full vesting period.</p>
<p>There are many other considerations to think about when it comes to stock options at part of your employee equity compensation package, such as when and how to exercise. To learn more about stock options and other forms of equity compensation, read our free &#8220;Guide to Employee Equity Compensation&#8221;.</p>

<p>How important is the impact of efficient tax management in your investment portfolio? Studies show that proper tax management can increase your portfolio’s return by 1% per year. Invested over 35 years, that can lead to a nearly 40% difference in the value of your portfolio.</p>

<p>While there are several ways you can effectively manage your taxes when it comes to your investments, disciplined portfolio maintenance can boost after-tax returns even further. One of the most powerful tax management techniques is tax-loss harvesting.</p>
<p>The Personal Capital Guide to Tax-Loss Harvesting explores what this powerful portfolio management tool is, and how you can use it to reduce your annual taxes. The cumulative tax savings can make a real difference in your life, whether that means retiring earlier, helping your kids pay for college, or leaving behind a larger legacy.</p>

					<p><span style="color: #000000;">Tax-loss harvesting is a technique you can use to proactively harvest available losses to offset gains by selling depreciated securities.</span></p>
<p>This simply means selling positions that have declined in value since you originally bought them, thereby realizing a “loss” (as defined by the IRS). These losses can be used to offset other gains you have realized during the year. This can help lower your overall tax bill since your tax is paid on the net amount.</p>
<p>It’s slightly counterintuitive – after all, you’re supposed to sell high, right? But the idea is not to eliminate exposure entirely; it’s only a temporary sale to reduce your tax bill, after which, if you want to, you can buy back the same stock following a 30-day waiting period. And even if you don’t have any gains to offset, the IRS allows you to deduct up to $3,000 in capital losses from your ordinary income each year (any loss in excess of $3,000 can be carried over and deducted in subsequent tax years).</p>
<p>It’s worth nothing that anyone can deduct $3,000 in losses—it’s completely independent of whether you do tax-loss harvesting. In addition, although you can deduct only $3,000 in a given year, you can carry the losses over to subsequent years until they’re exhausted. So, for example, if you lose $15,000 in one year, you have five years of IRS deductions that can offset gains or add to the loss carryover.</p>

					<p><span style="color: #000000;">A portfolio of stocks is likely to have both winners and losers in any given year. If left untouched, this can lead to material portfolio deviations where the changes in value in individual securities cause the portfolio to become imbalanced.</span></p>
<p>Tax-loss harvesting creates an opportunity to rebalance the portfolio back to model weight—you can claim losses and simultaneously pare down winners with large embedded gains. Capital losses are first used to offset capital gains, and if capital losses exceed capital gains, you can offset up to $3,000 of other taxable income per year. The end result is a helpful tax benefit: a potentially higher net after-tax return and a well-balanced portfolio.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that tax-loss harvesting tends to work best when you own individual securities, like stocks and bonds. Mutual funds don’t give you the opportunity to strategically sell positions. The known benefits of risk reduction and tax avoidance often justify the unknown benefit of hoping for a rebound in the stock that is down. Traditionally, investors consider selling assets in taxable (i.e., non-retirement) accounts that have losses at the end of the year.</p>

					<p><span style="color: #000000;">Effective tax-loss harvesting decreases your capital gains tax. </span></p>
<p>The capital gains tax is levied on the profit you receive from the sale of an investment. It’s typically owed once a sale is “realized,” i.e., when the asset is sold or exchanged at a price different from the original cost. You are only taxed on your return on investment if your net gains for that year are positive.</p>
<p>Capital gains tax is based on how long you have owned the asset. If you’ve held the asset for one year or less, the profit is considered a short-term capital gain; if held for more than one year, the profit is taxed as a long-term capital gain. Short-term capital gains are taxed as regular income, which for most taxpayers is a higher tax rate than the long-term capital gains rate.</p>

					<h2><strong>The Wash Sale Rule &amp; Tax-Loss Harvesting</strong></h2>

			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_85 et_pb_bg_layout_light  et_pb_text_align_left">


				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">
					<p><span style="color: #000000;">One caveat to tax-loss harvesting is that you must obey the 30-day wash sale rule. </span></p>
<p>This rule states that you cannot purchase the same security within 30 days before or after the sale and claim the loss; if you do so, your loss would most likely be deferred until the security is completely sold.</p>
<p>The rule goes a bit further to say that you also can’t buy a new security that is “substantially identical.” For instance, if you sold an S&amp;P 500 Index ETF to claim a loss, you can’t turn around and buy a new S&amp;P 500 Index ETF from a different provider inside of 30 days. But if you sold a handful of stocks, you could buy a broad-market equity ETF in their place. You would then hold it for 30 days to maintain stock exposure and avoid the wash sale rule.</p>
<p>The wash sale rule gets really complicated when a loss occurs when you purchase additional shares, purchase new shares, sell only a portion of the original or new shares, and hold on to shares. Additionally, the wash sale rule applies to the aggregate of your accounts, including your IRAs, so you will want to be very careful if you have the same stock in different brokerage accounts. A CPA can help you in these situations to make sure the wash sale rule is applied correctly.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to wait 31 days to buy the same stock or security, you may consider replacing the investment you sold at a loss with an exchange traded fund (ETF) tied to the company’s industry or sector. In this way, the ETF effectively serves as a temporary approximate proxy for individual stock holdings and still enables you to recognize the loss on your original position.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As investors across the globe have seen, the market experienced some volatility last week.</p>
<p>When markets start to get volatile, it’s important to remember a few basic investing principles. As you monitor your portfolio during volatile times, make sure to keep these important factors in mind.</p>
<h2>Market Volatility is Normal and it is Important Not to Overreact.</h2>
<p>With last week’s action, it may feel like the market has been bumpy, but when you look at markets historically it hasn’t been as extreme as it may have felt.</p>
<p>Last week, both the S&#038;P 500 and the Dow dropped more than 4%. Usually, the U.S. stock market declines in one out of every three years. When U.S. stock markets decline, the average drop is 14%. Volatility may feel concerning when you’re in the midst of it, but taking risk is also what drives wealth creation for stockowners.</p>
<p>During volatile market times, it’s crucial to maintain  patience and discipline. If you’re an investor, you’re also a human &#8211; meaning that it’s not so easy to kick back and stay calm during downward volatility. Nobody likes to see the value of their portfolio decline. So if you have a financial advisor, the most important thing he or she can do for you in times like this is help you avoid making rash portfolio changes &#8211; and stay the balanced long-term course.</p>
<h2>A Diversified Portfolio is the Best Way to Position for Whatever Comes Next.</h2>
<p>Regardless of market conditions, diversification is key. When market conditions are volatile, it’s a great time to assess how well diversified your portfolio is, and make any changes needed. Here are some resources on diversification:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/guide-portfolio-diversification/">A Beginner’s Guide to Portfolio Diversification</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing-markets/getting-ahead-of-the-curve-asset-allocation-2/">Asset Allocation: Getting Ahead of the Curve</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management">Schedule a free consultation with a financial advisor</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When markets are good, confident predictions can lead to mistakes that can derail your portfolio. You can’t control the markets, but you can take ownership of your investment strategy and asset allocation.</p>
<p>When stocks decline, your portfolio declines too. That’s why you diversify – to cushion against the blow of a decline like what we’ve seen in markets last week. If you’re invested in U.S. stocks, you’ve seen that the few hot stocks that were supporting the market have started to fall out of favor. On a relative basis, that bodes well for a more diversified sector and style approach. </p>
<p>We all know that markets go both up and down, and when they go up we’ll likely see substantial upside potential in a few battered and unloved sectors, like emerging markets stocks and bonds. Over the last several years U.S. stocks have trounced all other major asset classes. That won’t last forever, and folks that stay diversified and rebalance periodically will reap the benefits.</p>
<h2>Don’t Let Emotion Get the Best of You.</h2>
<p>Many experts suspect that a combination of the Fed indicating more rate hikes and Vice President Mike Pence announcing a tougher policy on China caused the recent market decline. While this could slow global growth, we aren’t predicting an imminent bear market (although that could still happen).</p>
<p>It’s normal for investors to be nervous during volatile markets, especially given how long it’s been since we’ve experienced a meaningful decline. We encourage investors not to succumb to the stress of a volatile market by bailing out or chasing the latest asset class that is doing well.<br />
As a rule of thumb, focus on a global, multi-asset class portfolio strategy to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns over time. And when the markets take a dip, remember the importance of a long-term plan for your personal situation that will ultimately provide the best chance to get the financial returns you need.</p>
<p>If you have any additional questions or concerns, contact a financial advisor.</p>

					<p class="yellow-text"><span style="color: #000000;">Employee equity compensation is a form of non-cash compensation that confers partial ownership in your company, i.e., non-cash compensation.</span></p>
<p>Both private and public companies have offered equity compensation for myriad reasons. One of the more common reasons is that offering non-cash compensation allows companies to prioritize cash flows to continue to grow the company or for other initiatives; another benefit is that it can be used to lure quality employees to work for them and to keep those talented individuals employed and motivated.</p>

<p>These restrictions are meant to encourage employee retention and align incentives between the employee and the firm. When these criteria are met, the option will vest and the stock becomes available for exercise and ownership. These restrictions generally apply to restricted stock and stock options (since participation in employee stock purchase plans are usually up to the employee’s discretion whether to participate).</p>

				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>Sometimes called “service restrictions,” this restriction relates to the length of time you are with the company.</p>
<p>A “typical” time restriction might say that your options vest monthly over four years with a one-year “cliff.” This means no vesting occurs on your options for your first year. After your first anniversary date, 25% of your grant vests and the remaining portion will vest monthly for the remaining three years.</p>

<p>Market events can also impact performance restrictions. For example, in the event of an IPO, the performance date is set for a specified amount of time after the IPO. The extra buffer is called a “lock-up,” and prevents employees from flooding the market with stock sales. This type of restrictions isn’t necessarily applicable to all compensation types; ESPPs, for example, usually allow all employees to participate without it being dependent on their performance.</p>

<p>These can be further broken down. Stock options generally can be categorized as either Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) or Nonstatutory Stock Options (NSOs), which are commonly known as Non-Qualified Stock Options (NQOs). On the other hand, restricted stock (in the context of equity compensation) begins its life as either Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) or Restricted Stock Awards (RSAs).</p>
<p>Each type of compensation has unique characteristics, so it’s important to identify what your equity compensation is so you can understand its benefits and potential challenges.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different terms and definitions around equity compensation, which can get confusing – especially because there are different names for essentially the same things. <em><strong>O</strong><strong>pen the drop-down menu for a glossary of some of the most common terms you should know.</strong></em> Keep in mind, these are high-level definitions, and their exact meaning may change depending on what type of compensation they’re applied to.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Stock option</strong> – A formal, written offer for a company to sell (and for you to purchase) stock at a specified price, subject to time limits and conditions specified in the option agreement.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Restricted Stock Unit/Award (RSU/RSA)</strong> – Equity compensation offered to an employee by way of an agreement in which you’ll receive shares of stock (for cash payment, in the case of some RSAs) on a future date.  The unit/award should not be confused with “restricted stock.” </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bargain Element</strong> – Also known as  the “spread,” this refers to the “discount” for the purchase of stock at a price that is lower than the Fair Market Value (FMV) on the purchase date; essentially, this is the difference between FMV of the stock at the time of grant and its exercise price.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Fair Market Value (FMV)</strong> – The price at which the stock is currently trading (private companies may calculate this in slightly different ways compared to companies that are publicly traded).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Grant date</strong> – The date that your units, shares, or options are offered to you by your employer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Vesting date</strong> – The date (or dates) on which restrictions lapse and the stock becomes available for transfer to you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Vesting (vesting schedule)</strong> – The schedule dictating when you may exercise your stock options or when forfeiture restrictions lapse for restricted stock. Vesting is typically a time-based “waiting period,” which you have to complete before you can exercise options. Vesting is determined separately for each grant.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Exercise</strong> – When you notify the company you want to purchase the stock and provide payment per the terms of your agreement.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Exercise date</strong> – The date on which you have the option (but not obligation) to buy or sell the security instrument at a specified price. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Exercise price/strike price</strong> – The pre-set price at which you are able to exercise your right to purchase shares of company stock (typically FMV on the date of the grant).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sale date</strong> – The date when you legally dispose of the stock that was acquired, whether it’s by sale, gift or other transfer (as allowed by the plan).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Disqualifying disposition</strong> – The legal term for selling, transferring, or exchanging shares before satisfying the holding period requirements; i.e., two years from date of grant and one year from date of exercise. If you sell, transfer, gift or short the stock too soon, you lose the tax benefits.</span></li>

<p>Stock options are probably the most well-known form of equity compensation.</p>
<p>A stock option is the right to buy a specific number of shares of company stock at a pre-set price, known as the “exercise” or “strike price,” for a fixed period of time, usually following a predetermined waiting period, called the “vesting period.” Most vesting periods span follow three to five years, with a certain percentage of options vesting (which means you’ve “earned” your shares, though you still need to exercise (i.e., purchase them).</p>
<p>When it comes to options, one of their biggest advantages is leverage. With more options per grant relative to other forms of equity compensation, there is significant upside potential But despite the upside, these don’t come without risk.</p>
				</div>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">The Appeal of Stock Options</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p><span style="color: #000000;">Stock options are commonly used to attract prospective employees and to retain current employees.</span></p>
<p>The incentive of stock options to a prospective employee is the possibility of owning stock of the company at a discounted rate compared to buying the stock on the open market.</p>
<p>The retention of employees who have been granted stock options occurs through a technique called vesting. Vesting helps employers encourage employees to stay through the vesting period to obtain the shares granted to them. Your options don’t belong to you until you have met the requirements of the vesting schedule.</p>
<p>For example, assume you have been granted 10,000 shares with a four-year vesting schedule at 2,500 shares at the end of each year. This means you have to stay for at least one full year in order to exercise the first 2,500 shares and must stay to the end of the fourth year to be able to exercise all 10,000 shares. In order to receive your full grant, you will likely have to stay with your company the full vesting period.</p>

			</div> <!-- .et_pb_toggle --><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_toggle et_pb_toggle_29 et_pb_toggle_item  et_pb_toggle_close">


				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">When You Can Exercise</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p><span style="color: #000000;">First and foremost, you cannot exercise your options until they are vested.</span></p>
<p>There may be some agreements that can accelerate the vesting schedule (e.g., in the event of an acquisition), but these are rare. And there are also time limits on when you can exercise or access your options – they typically expire after 10 years from the date of grant. In addition, if you are laid off before you are vested in your options or your company is acquired by another company, you may lose your unvested options. See each section for ISOs and NSOs on some possible exercising strategies.</p>

			</div> <!-- .et_pb_toggle --><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_toggle et_pb_toggle_30 et_pb_toggle_item  et_pb_toggle_close">


				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">How You Can Exercise</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>Once you are ready to exercise your options, you typically have several ways of doing so:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Cash Payment</strong> &#8211;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">You can come up with the cash to exercise the options. This would include covering any costs to acquire the stock. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Cashless Exercise</strong> –</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Some employers allow you to exercise your options and your employer sells just enough of the stock to cover the costs you incurred to acquire the stock.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>You can sell all the shares you exercise at the going market price</strong>, which means you won’t have any ongoing exposure to any stock price volatility and you won’t have to come up with the upfront cash for any transaction costs when you exercise. However, the tax implications may not be beneficial, depending on your unique situation.</span></li>

					<h3>Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)</h3>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">What are ISOs?</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p><span style="color: #000000;">Incentive stock options (ISOs) – also referred to as Qualified Stock Options – can be granted only to employees of a company (independent contractors are not permitted).</span></p>
<p>While many people get excited about options and what their value might mean for their financial futures, it’s good to remember there are certain strategies you can either implement or avoid to ensure you are getting the outcome you want.</p>
				</div> <!-- .et_pb_toggle_content -->
			</div> <!-- .et_pb_toggle --><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_toggle et_pb_toggle_32 et_pb_toggle_item  et_pb_toggle_close">


				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">ISO Tax Treatment</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p><span style="color: #000000;">ISOs potentially have more favorable tax treatment than many other types of employee equity compensation.</span></p>
<p>This is because they are not taxed for regular tax purposes until they are sold. However, to qualify for the treatment as capital gains tax on a standard tax return, you must hold the shares two years from grant and one year from exercise (if you don’t meet this requirement, then the sale will be treated as a disqualifying disposition). If these dates are met and the value of the stock increases, you’ll only owe long-term capital gains tax when you sell.</p>
<p>While ISOs are not taxed for regular tax purposes until they are sold (if you meet the holding requirements), the alternative minimum tax (AMT) may be applicable at time of exercise. If you pay AMT upon exercise of the options, you may be entitled to an AMT tax credit that can be used to lower your income tax bill in subsequent tax years when the amount you owe is more than it would have been under the AMT.</p>
<p>Note that the bargain element (again, the difference between the grant price and the exercise price) is considered an AMT preference in the year that you exercise your ISOs. In order to determine if you are subject to AMT, you have to complete your regular IRS Form 1040 and Form 6251 to determine if you are subject to AMT. You’ll owe taxes on the greater of your regular tax or the tax determined under the AMT calculations.</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Exercising ISOs</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p><span style="color: #000000;">ISOs can be a bit trickier to exercise than NSOs because tax consequences depend on how long you hold the shares.</span></p>
<p>If you hold on to your shares for the qualification period (two years after grant, one year after exercise) and things go well, then the stock will go up in value, and as mentioned before, you will likely only owe long-term capital gains rates when you sell. You may, however, still need to put up a sizable amount of cash upon exercise (depending on the strike price). And it’s possible your stock’s value could just as easily go the other way, which means you would erase any potential gains – and in some cases, may have to pay out of pocket to cover taxes. Talk to your financial advisor or tax expert to learn more.</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">What are NSOs?</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p><span style="color: #000000;">Nonstatutory Stock Options (NSOs) are also known as Non-Qualified Stock Options (NQOs).</span></p>
<p>They are typically used by more mature companies for higher-paid employees (as well as contractors, consultants and other non-employees, if companies want to give them more than $100,000 worth annually). Because NSOs do not meet the requirements of IRS Code Section 422, they do not benefit from the (potential) corresponding tax benefits that ISOs do.</p>
				</div> <!-- .et_pb_toggle_content -->

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">NSO Tax Treatment</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p><span style="color: #000000;">Typically, NSOs are taxed at the date of exercise rather than the date of grant.</span></p>
<p>The amount subject to ordinary income tax is the difference between the fair market value at the time of exercise and the exercise price. If you continue to hold the stock after exercise, any gain in price is subject to capital gains rules (long-term, if you hold for more than 12 months).</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you are granted 300 shares of XYZ, Inc., on January 1, 2016, with an exercise price of $10 per share, with 100 shares vesting each year for the next three years. After the first year, you exercise 100 vested shares when the FMV is $30. The amount reported as ordinary income is $2,000 – (i.e., [$30 FMV – $10 exercise] x 100 shares). Let’s say you hold the stock for one more year and sell when the FMV is $42. The amount subject to capital gains tax then is $1,200 (i.e., [$42 FMV &#8211; $30] x 100 shares).</p>
<p>NSOs are subject to ordinary income tax and reported as W-2 wages for employees. They are also subject to federal and state income taxes, as well as Social Security and Medicare taxes.</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Diversifying After Exercising NSOs</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p><span style="color: #000000;">Since NSOs are taxed as ordinary income upon exercise, we generally recommend diversifying right away if you are deep in the money and there is no special reason to defer income (vs. holding and hoping the stock goes up).</span></p>
<p>If you exercised shares in the past and now hold a material amount of stock, then it can often make sense to start diversifying. It’s usually good to start with the highest-cost, long-term lots first. The amount to sell will likely come down to how much you’re comfortable with. You should consult a tax advisor and a financial professional to learn more.</p>

					<p style="text-align: center;"><b>PERSONAL CAPITAL STRATEGY: SOME TAX IMPLICATIONS</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tax rules that apply to stock options are complex, so here are some very high-level, general rules of thumb:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>If you wait to hit certain milestones, your tax treatment may be better<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You could receive favorable tax treatment if you wait for two years from grant date and one year from date of exercise to sell your shares. Once these two milestones are met, any profit you generate from the sale of your stock will be taxed as long-term capital gains. (Note: this holding period is only applicable to ISOs, and you could be subject to taxation when you exercise the share.) </span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exercising or selling before milestones can mean ordinary income treatment</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you sell or dispose of the stock within a year of exercising (or after more than a year, but less than two years from grant date), the gains will be subject to ordinary income tax treatment, rather than the often lower-tax long-term capital gain treatment. However, there may be scenarios in which disposing of the shares before meeting the milestones may be advantageous.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">Keep in mind that these are very high-level guidelines; since every situation is unique, you should check with a professional to see if these apply to you.</span></p>

					<p><span style="color: #000000;">Restricted stock (which may also be known as “letter stock” or “restricted securities”) is company stock that cannot be fully transferable until certain restrictions have been met.</span></p>
<p>These can be performance or timing restrictions, similar to restrictions for options. You can think of restricted stock as a bonus awarded as stock instead of cash; however, like cash, it is taxed as if it was paid in cash (i.e., as ordinary income).</p>
<p>Restricted stock can be a popular alternative to stock options, particularly for executives, due to their favorable accounting rules and income tax treatment. There are two basic types of restricted stock: Restricted Stock Awards (RSAs) and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs).</p>

<p>Typically, companies issue shares that are held in escrow and are released upon vesting. RSAs come with immediate voting rights because you actually own the stock the moment the award is granted.</p>

			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_toggle et_pb_toggle_39 et_pb_toggle_item  et_pb_toggle_close">


				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">What are RSUs?</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>Like RSAs, Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) represent an employer’s promise to grant the difference in price (stock price minus strike price) to employees based on vesting requirements, performance benchmarks and/or transferability restrictions.</p>
<p>The key difference is that RSUs are issued in the form of units – not stock – that correspond in number and value to a specified number of shares of employer stock. Upon vesting, you’ll get your equivalent shares. The result of this difference is that you are not deemed to be the holder of the shares until vesting and do not have voting rights (unlike with RSAs). This makes it a particularly popular mechanism for pre-IPO companies: RSU holders are not technically shareholders and increasing ownership does not trigger SEC filing rules.</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">RSU Tax Treatment</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p><span style="color: #000000;">RSUs can be awarded on regular vesting schedules or performance benchmarks, which means that the value of the RSUs on the day of vesting is subject to payroll and ordinary income taxation.</span></p>
<p>Similar to the concept of a cashless exercise, some employers allow stock to be withheld to cover the statutory minimum for taxes in the form of shares, since RSUs are taxed on vesting. This provides for a net stock amount to the employee, adjusted for taxes, upon vesting. The disposition method is not restricted after vesting, unless the company is subject to “open window” trading policies.</p>

					<h3>Purchase Strategies &#8211; Restricted Stock</h3>
<p>When you’re offered equity by your company, you need to decide how you exercise the shares. But note, if the grant is restricted stock with par value, accepting the grant means you’ll eventually be required to pay for those options when they vest.</p>
<p>There are typically three standard methods that you can choose within 30 days of the settlement date (the date and time that your transfer of shares is made, which establishes the legal transfer of ownership).</p>
				</div>
			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_toggle et_pb_toggle_41 et_pb_toggle_item  et_pb_toggle_close">


				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Three Standard Purchasing Methods</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Pay cash</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – You receive all your shares and cover your income tax burden with your own cash. So, if you believe your company’s share price is going up, this might be an attractive strategy; however, it’s riskier as you end up with equity and will deplete your cash reserves to cover the income tax burden.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cashless: Exercise and sell to cover</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – You receive only the portion of shares after covering the cost of your income taxes with shares. For example, if you were entitled to 100,000 shares and pay a 35% marginal tax rate, you’d get 65,000 shares. Because market price doesn’t impact your tax rate, this is likely the least risky strategy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cashless: Exercise and sell</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – You sell your shares immediately and cover the purchase price, commissions, fees, and taxes. This is like paying cash, since you assume the risk of the share price (for the period of time before you sell), but it may make sense because you don’t have to raise the cash to pay your tax obligations.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure to talk to your employer to see what options are available to you.</span></p>

					<p><span style="color: #000000;">An Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) is a plan in which employees are offered the ability to purchase shares of the company at a discount (commonly 15% of FMV).</span></p>
<p>ESPP plans are limited to a maximum of $25,000 worth of stock, per year, per employee. Shares/units are typically purchased via payroll deductions. Usually, at designated points during the year, your employer then uses the accumulated funds to purchase stock for you.</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Case Study: ESPPs and Taxes</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p><span style="color: #000000;">Melvin has an ESPP with his company, XYZ, Inc., and he is in the 32% regular income tax bracket and the 15% long-term capital gains tax bracket.</span></p>
<p>Here are three different scenarios that impact Melvin tax-wise when he sells, depending on qualifying and disqualifying dispositions.</p>
<p><b>Scenario 1: Qualifying Disposition</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melvin holds the position for more than two years, from the beginning of the offering period, including more than one year from the date he purchased. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The offer period was from January 1, 2016, to June 30, 2016. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price for XYZ, Inc., on January 1, 2016, was $100.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price for XYZ, Inc., on June 30, 2016, was $125.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melvin purchased on July 1, 2016, at a 15% discount to the January 1, 2016 price of $100, which means he had a purchase price of $85 ($100 x [100% &#8211; 15%]).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melvin sold on February 24, 2018, for $130 – his $15 discount is taxed as ordinary income and the remaining $30 gain is taxed as long-term capital gains.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melvin’s tax upon selling is ($15 x 0.32) + ($30 x 0.15) = $9.30.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: The bargain element of $15 should be included as ordinary income.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Scenario 2: Disqualifying Disposition, but Held Long-Term</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assume that everything from Scenario 1 is still true, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">except </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melvin holds the position for less than two years from the beginning of the offering period. His sale is then considered “disqualified,” but he still realizes the long-term capital gains tax rate on his sale.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melvin sells XYZ, Inc., on December 15, 2017 – less than two years from the offer period – when it sells for $130.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melvin then owes ordinary income tax on the discount of July 1, 2016 ($125 &#8211; $85 = $40).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melvin’s tax upon selling is ($40 x 0.32) + ($5 x 0.15) = $13.55. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: Typically under a disqualifying disposition, your employer will include the bargain element as part of W-2 wages.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Scenario 3: Disqualifying Disposition and Held Short-Term</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, imagine the same scenario but Melvin sold XYZ, Inc., for $130 on June 15, 2017. His sale is therefore considered disqualified, and his full gain is taxed as short-term gains (i.e., ordinary income)</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melvin’s tax upon selling is ($40 x 0.32) + ($5 x 0.32) = $14.40</span></li>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">
					<p><span style="color: #000000;">Here are some guidelines that can give you a frame of reference.</span></p>
<p>However, given the array of equity compensation structures out there with varied terms and tax consequences, it’s best to consult a professional for your unique situation.</p>
				</div>
			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_toggle et_pb_toggle_44 et_pb_toggle_item  et_pb_toggle_close">


				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Options</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p><span style="color: #000000;">Because the effective value of your options is the market price less the exercise price, small changes in market price are amplified in your effective value, which boosts your options’ inherent investment leverage.</span></p>
<p>In other words, the same absolute price movement is higher on a percentage basis for your “equity.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, just as gains are magnified, so are losses. Options have little value unless the market value is greater than the exercise price, which creates a bit more risk than other forms of equity. If you exercise your options and the price </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">decreases</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then you lose both the money you’ve used to exercise the shares as well as any associated taxes.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">ISOs – These can be a little tricky – they can be treated as NSOs in certain circumstances, or you can try to hold onto them until they become long-term for preferential tax treatment, which comes with more risk</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">NSOs – There’s no hard-and-fast rule here, but it’s generally a good idea to have more aggressive diversification if they are deep in the money (~33%-plus) and there is no special reason to defer income. </span><b>Do not let in-the-money options expire.</b></li>

				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p><span style="color: #000000;">These types of equity compensation are taxed at the time they are vested.</span></p>
<p>In essence, you have purchased your company’s stock at the current market price. This means you should make the decision to sell them based on the stock price at the time of vesting and how large your investment is in your company’s stock. Holding your vested shares instead of selling them is similar to purchasing your company stock with your bonus check – unless you have a strong reason for keeping your company’s stock, it’s generally recommended that you sell as soon as your shares vest.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Additional Considerations</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p><span style="color: #000000;">There are additional considerations when it comes to your equity awards. Some of these include:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concentrated positions</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – A position is usually considered “concentrated” when it makes up more than 5% to 6% of your liquid net worth. If the vested/sellable portion of your equity awards exceeds this amount, there is normally an increased urgency to pare down (see the following section on Employee Equity Compensation &amp; Your Portfolio)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private company</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – If you have stock options for a private company, you likely will want to be very cautious about exercising your shares since you may not be able to sell until/unless there is a liquidity event</span></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax bracket</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Depending on the circumstances, it may make sense to defer a portion of sales until the following year if realizing gains will raise either your federal income or long-term gains tax bracket. Or, if diversifying your portfolio is more of a concern and your tax bracket won’t change from year to year, it might make sense just to incur the tax hit so that your overall concentration makes sense.  </span></li>

					<p style="text-align: center;"><b>PERSONAL CAPITAL STRATEGY: A FEW TIPS ON EXERCISING</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’ve mentioned before, employee equity compensation is complex and unique to your own individual situation. How you exercise will depend on many different variables; however, here are a few additional tips to consider when exercising:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider exercising early with cash if it makes sense. It starts the clock early on capital gains. The main risk, however, is the loss or opportunity cost of the capital that you use. If you’re leaving your job, then you may be forced to go this route.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about whether you may benefit from a cashless exercise if your shares are liquid or if your company will buy them back. This way, you don’t have to raise cash, and you’ll be hedging by taking some of your shares off the table if the share price goes down. Sure, you may pay more tax, but you’re not putting your existing capital at risk.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re concerned about the volatility of the stock, then don’t wait. Exercise and sell right away. You’re stuck paying ordinary income tax by exercising and selling at the same time, but this might be a better alternative than stomaching any volatility. If the share price decreases, then you won’t have to concern yourself with AMT, although you might have missed out on some gains, too.</span></li>

					<p><span style="color: #000000;">Many people think that equity compensation is automatically equal to a windfall – the next Facebook or Instagram story.</span></p>
<p>But the truth is, this is usually not the case for the majority of us. Equity can be a great form of compensation, since it aligns incentives between employees and employers and enables employees to build long-term wealth. However, while equity compensation may provide you more upside, beware: it can create complications relative to cash compensation. That’s why it is so important to understand how much stock is in your portfolio and how that plays into your overall net worth and future financial plans.</p>
<p>Equity compensation is applicable in both the startup and corporate worlds. But the scenarios are not all equal, and not all recipients find themselves on a path to riches, contrary to popular perception. The extent to which you will benefit from an equity compensation package depends on not only upon the performance of the stock, but also on how well you manage key decisions relating to your equity. In particular, understanding the type of equity you have and the associated tax implications is critical to your success – as is understanding the risk of investing in an individual stock versus a diversified portfolio.</p>
				</div>
			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_toggle et_pb_toggle_48 et_pb_toggle_item  et_pb_toggle_close">


				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Managing Exposure</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p><span style="color: #000000;">It’s not uncommon for company stock to dominate an individual portfolio. This trend is pronounced in areas like Silicon Valley, where capital-hungry companies defer cash compensation to their hard-working employees by promising a share of future growth via equity.</span></p>
<p>When you are armed with an understanding of your current financial standing and where you want to be, you can design a game plan for managing your company stock as part of your wealth management strategy.</p>
<p>One big question is: how much of your company stock is it appropriate for you to own? There’s no exact answer – all of our financial pictures are different, and you can’t predict how that stock will perform. For instance, consider that the volatility of a single stock is high – according to <a href="http://news.morningstar.com/classroom2/course.asp?docId=142859&amp;page=2&amp;CN=com">Morningstar</a>, the average difference between the yearly high and low of stock prices of a typical NYSE stock is 40%.</p>

					<p style="text-align: center;"><b>PERSONAL CAPITAL STRATEGY: UNDERSTANDING THE VALUE</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are starting a new job and equity compensation is part of your package, there are some good questions to ask your hiring manager or a member of HR to help you get a handle on what they might be worth. Then you can negotiate other terms based on that knowledge. Some good starting questions include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What type of equity compensation are you offering? Each kind comes with its own restrictions and tax ramifications, all of which impact what they could ultimately be worth to you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the current valuation of the company? Sometimes the calculations can be skewed, or companies are not able to give that information (although, lack of transparency can also be a red flag), but it’s good to at least have a starting point. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many outstanding shares are there? This directly impacts the value of your equity. After all, 1,000 shares might sound good on paper, but if there are 3,000,000 shares, then that doesn’t necessarily equal a huge value to you.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What type of equity am I getting? There are many different types, all with different restrictions and consequences.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do the stock documents say? Reading the fine print takes time, patience, and understanding, but it’s crucial to knowing the ultimate worth of what you’re being offered.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more information you’re armed with, the better you can understand what your equity compensation could ultimately be worth.  Speak with a financial advisor to learn more.</span></p>

					<p><span style="color: #000000;">When it comes to employee equity compensation, you’re oftentimes putting yourself into a speculative position.</span></p>
<p>Sure, you have the chance of potentially coming into a big windfall, but keep in mind that you’re also placing a bet that the employer who signs your paycheck is going to be successful.</p>
<p>The risk comes if – like many working Americans – most of your net worth is tied up into this. That’s why it’s important to understand what awards you have, what the vesting schedule is in your situation, and what tax consequences you might have so you aren’t unnecessarily overpaying, while also managing concentration risk within your overall allocation. Also, you should understand that while taxes are an important aspect to consider, they should not be the underlying reason a diversification strategy isn’t implemented.</p>
<p>Rather than let your employer stock dominate your portfolio, part of managing your wealth is figuring out how to sell down some of your shares to build a diversified portfolio across the major global asset classes that’s appropriate for your risk tolerance and helps you maximize your return.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a id="trackExitButton" class="marketing-link-large" href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/whitepapers/guide-to-end-of-year-tax-planning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read the Guide.</a></p>
<p>Improper tax management can cost you more than a quarter of your long-term return, severely limiting spending power in retirement. The good news is that taxes can be managed. There are four key areas where investors can place their tax focus:</p>
<h2>Tax Efficiency</h2>
<p>Thousands of potential investment vehicles exist today, each with radically different tax implications. Choosing and using tax-efficient investments is a vital first step toward keeping more of your money. Here are some general guidelines when it comes to common investment vehicles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mutual Funds</strong>are notoriously bad in terms of tax management.</li>
<li><strong>Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)</strong> are generally more tax efficient than mutual funds.</li>
<li><strong>Individual Stocks</strong> can be the most tax-efficient way to gain exposure to equities.</li>
<li><strong>Bond ETFs</strong> and passive bond mutual funds are generally more tax efficient than actively managed bond mutual funds, but the tax treatment of income generated from bonds differs from that of equities.</li>
<li><strong>Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)</strong> dividends are generally taxed as ordinary income to shareholders.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tax Location</h2>
<p>If you have multiple investments, do you consider the most appropriate account for each of your assets? If not, you should. Each of your accounts has unique tax characteristics, and if you understand these characteristics, you can place your assets in the most advantageous accounts, thereby minimizing your tax liabilities. This is called tax location. Depending upon the underlying characteristics of the investment, strategically placing it in either a taxable, tax-deferred, or tax-exempt account may improve your annual return.</p>
<p>So what securities go where? One general rule is to place high-yield stocks in tax- deferred or -exempt accounts, like IRAs and Roth IRAs, and low-yield or no-yield stocks in taxable accounts. Fixed income investments are a little trickier. It’s good to keep in mind, optimizing around long-term growth rates and tax rates can get very complicated, so you should consult a professional.</p>
<h2>Tax Loss Harvesting</h2>
<p>Tax loss harvesting is the process of intentionally realizing losses to offset realized gains. It’s slightly counterintuitive — after all, you’re supposed to sell high, right? But the idea is not to eliminate exposure entirely; it’s only a temporary sale to reduce your tax bill, after which you buy back the same stock.</p>
<p>Tax-loss harvesting works even if you want to maintain exposure to the stocks that have lost value, but there are some rules. To avoid the “wash sale” rule, you cannot repurchase the same or a substantially identical stock within 30 days before or after selling at a loss. Even if you don’t have any gains to offset, you can deduct up to $3,000 in losses from your taxable income, resulting in a higher net after-tax return.</p>
<p>To learn more, read our free Guide to Tax-Loss Harvesting:</p>

<h2>Roth Conversions</h2>
<p>Starting in 2010, it became possible for high-income people to convert their traditional IRA accounts to Roth IRAs. This can be an important decision, and it’s worth spending the time to figure out if it is right for you. Generally speaking, if you expect your tax rate to be higher, then you may want to consider converting. If you expect it to be about the same, a more detailed analysis is required. Often there is still an advantage to the Roth conversion because the converted money will be able to grow tax free while the opportunity cost from the taxes paid from post-tax accounts will be subject to taxes on dividends and capital gains along the way.</p>
<p>A Roth conversion can also generate a large tax bill, and it matters how you go about paying it. A Roth conversion only makes sense if you can pay the tax bill with funds from an outside non-retirement account.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life is full of uncertainties. We protect our families with life insurance and our cars and homes with auto and homeowner’s policies.</p>
<p>But how do we protect our financial futures?</p>
<p>Even during times of relative stability in the financial markets, having a long-term financial plan in place that is built to weather the unknowns is a smart move to make. The market is, after all, rarely driven by just one factor – that’s why it’s so hard to time the ups and downs. Investors with a strategic plan can feel more confident about their finances and don’t have to worry about outguessing factors beyond their control.</p>
<p>There’s a saying: “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” The <em>Personal Capital Investor’s Guide to Volatile Markets</em> is designed to help you prepare for – or react to – what the market might throw at you. With a long-term plan and clear goals in place, we believe that you can navigate your way through the up and down times to achieve your financial goals.</p>
<p>Like many things in life, luck and timing play a big role in your financial success in retirement. These factors may be beyond your control, but regardless of how they play out, it’s up to you to exercise control where you can.</p>
<p>Read our free guide to learn more about:</p>
<ul>
<li>The impact of behavioral finance &#8211; recognize the impact that risk tolerance, emotions, and recency bias can have on you and your investments.</li>
<li>Diversification as a safeguard &#8211; predicting the market is never effective long term; diversification can be one of the strongest safeguards against market volatility.</li>
<li>Steps to take now &#8211; a few tips can help protect your portfolio from one of its biggest enemies: your emotions.</li>
<li>Questions to ask yourself &#8211; when it comes to weathering market volatility, it&#8217;s important to ask the right questions to see if you can weather any storm.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The global equity correction picked up steam this week.  A hawkish Fed tone caused rates to initially spike, there were concerns over slowing global growth, and trade tensions weighed on markets.  </p>
<p>Early in the week, there was indiscriminate selling of both stocks and bonds, with popular momentum and technology stocks leading the way down.  The start of the Q3 earning season is also causing some angst as investors question if lofty earnings growth estimates are sustainable in the face of peak margin concerns from input price pressures.    </p>
<h2>Weekly Return</h2>
<p>S&#038;P 500: 2,767 (-4.1%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US (VEU): (-3.38%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 3.15% (-2.48%)<br />
Gold: $1,222 (+1.36%)<br />
EUR/USD: 1.156 (.3%)</p>
<h2>Major Events</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monday – The International Monetary Fund cut its global economic growth outlook for the next two years citing NAFTA, Brexit, and continued trade war uncertainties.</li>
<li>Monday – Tensions rose between the European Union and Italy over Italy’s budget and U.S.-China strains escalated during the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s visit to Beijing.</li>
<li>Tuesday – U.S. Treasury Yields hit a seven-year high.</li>
<li>Wednesday – Technology companies had their worst day in seven years.</li>
<li>Thursday – The global market rout continued across major equity indices with the S&#038;P 500 notching its sixth straight day of losses.</li>
<li>Thursday – The U.S. Treasury concluded that China is not manipulating the Yuan in their report to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.</li>
<li>Friday – The IMF and World Bank meetings began in Bali Friday.</li>
<li>Friday – Wells Fargo, J.P. Morgan, and Citi Group kicked off earning season with earnings that beat analysts’ expectations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>There was plenty of market news to digest this week, but we believe that two key independent speeches by prominent U.S. figures played a major role in triggering the spike in this week’s volatility.  </p>
<p>The first was from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who on October 3rd said, “We may go past neutral [interest rates], but we’re a long way from neutral, probably.”  This confirmed for many, a real shift to a less accommodative Fed and the likelihood of more rate hikes.  As a result, interest rates spiked across the yield curve, bond prices fell, and equity investors reconsidered how stocks will fare with higher rates; a stark contrast to the zero-interest rate environment enjoyed during much of this bull market.</p>
<p>The second was from Vice President Mike Pence, who a day later announced a tougher policy on China and declared in a combative speech that the United States would “not stand down”.  The speech included a wide range of accusations delivered by Pence that claimed, “Beijing is employing a whole-of-government approach, using political, economic, and military tools, as well as propaganda, to advance its influence and benefit its interests in the United States.”  At a minimum, the implications suggest little optimism for a resolution on trade conflict anytime soon. </p>
<p>U.S. stocks remain modestly up for the year, but global stocks (X U.S.) are down around 10%.  Market pullbacks are to be expected, but predicting their length and severity is a fool’s game.  Instead, they serve as an important reminder of the risks associated with making concentrated bets in the market.  Crowded trades, like the current popularity of momentum and technology stocks are especially susceptible to market corrections.  We reiterate our view that a balanced and diversified approach to investing geared toward limiting damages of market corrections, like we saw this week and over the long term, is superior.  If nothing else, we believe this should be a wakeup call for those who are heavily concentrated to reassess the risk in their portfolio.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The end of September marked the end of the third quarter, a strong period for U.S. stocks but lackluster for almost all other major asset classes. </p>
<p>During September alone, foreign developed stocks posted gains and outpaced their U.S. counterparts, while emerging markets continued a downward trend. Within U.S. equities, small-cap stocks sharply reversed after outperforming in August, ending the month in negative territory. A strong rally in oil prices boosted energy stocks and commodities, while bonds and gold posted declines amidst higher U.S. interest rates. </p>
<p>Most of the same stories continued to dominate headlines. There was a brief period when global trade tensions appeared to ease, but relations between the U.S. and China soured yet again. Regardless, daily reactions to the news appear to be diminishing—a sign of investors’ increased acceptance that the trade conflict could be a long and drawn out process.</p>
<p>With respect to interest rates, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its target benchmark rate by 0.25% for the third time in 2018, while simultaneously providing an upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy. This was widely expected and lends further support to another expected hike in December, and potentially three more in 2019. </p>
<p>As we approach November, the U.S. midterm elections are likely to capture an increasing share of the spotlight, with many expecting Democrats to take control of the House. A divided Congress would likely mean more noise and investigations, but less action. This may be a positive for stocks, which tend to enjoy a softer legislative agenda. Moreover, the calendar year following midterm elections has historically been very strong, posting an average annual return of approximately 17.9% since 1927.</p>

					<h3><strong>PERSONAL CAPITAL STRATEGY: HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU AIM TO SAVE?</strong></h3>
<p>Not sure what number to put in your plan? A good “average” tuition cost to aim for is $25,000 per year for public schools, and $40,000 per year for private schools. If you have a baby or toddler and you’re saving with a 529, shoot for funding roughly 30% of the expected cost upfront, if you have the funds available. A good starting amount is $28,000, since that will keep you under the annual gifting limit (gifting limits are $15,000 per person per recipient and $30,000 for a married couple per recipient in 2018). You have the option to add more without a penalty, but it complicates your tax situation. If you don’t have $28,000 upfront, start by contributing $250 per month to a 529 account (assuming you have a young child who will be attending a public university).</p>
<p>As your baby or toddler grows into a young child, aim to have 50-70% of the expected cost of the education or your funding goal — continue increasing that amount as your child nears college.</p>

					<p class="yellow-text"><span style="color: #000000;">There are different ways to finance your child&#8217;s education, all with different benefits and challenges. You should familiarize yourself with the options and their impact on your taxes and savings.</span></p>
<p>Since 529 Plans were first established in 1996, Section 529 savings plans have become a popular tool used by parents to save for future college expenses. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/29/its-529-day-yet-71-percent-of-people-dont-know-what-a-college-savings-plan-is.html">According to the College Savings Plans Network</a>, the average 529 account size grew 13% in 2017 from the year prior to a record $24,057. In the same year, total investments in these plans reached $319.1 billion – a 16% increase over 2016</p>
<p>The plans continue to grow in popularity as an education savings tool. One reason 529 plans are so popular is the tax breaks they allow. As long as funds are used to pay for qualified education expenses, earnings within the account grow tax free. Also, many states allow full or partial deductions for 529 plan contributions.</p>
<h3>How do 529 Plans Work?</h3>
<p>Money saved in a Section 529 account can be used to pay for a wide range of different kinds of education expenses. These include not only tuition, fees, books, and room and board, but also computer technology, computer equipment and related services, such as Internet access. Keep in mind, there are specific requirements for each of these types of expenses to be considered qualified education expenses. requirements.</p>
<p>There are two main types of Section 529 plans:</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Prepaid Tuition Plans</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>Prepaid tuition plans lock in a specific amount of future tuition at today’s prices.</p>
<p>This means you could buy four years of college now for your newborn at today’s tuition rate, which is probably much lower than it will be 18 years from now.</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Investment Savings Plans</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>Investment savings plans are more like retirement savings accounts.</p>
<p>They enable you to invest your college savings in stocks, bonds and mutual funds to try to maximize returns. Remember, though, that there’s no guarantee your investments will be successful, so these may be riskier.</p>
<p>For both types of 529 Plans, your child may not be restricted to attending school in the particular state where your 529 plan is opened – or even the United States. Some 529 plans allow funds can be used to pay for educational costs for schools located outside the United States and vocational-technical schools. However, some states may not allow this, so it’s best to contact the 529 provider for their input on the potential use of the funds.</p>

					<h3>529 Plans &amp; Tax Considerations</h3>
<p>Tax benefits on 529 plans vary by state. States like Indiana offer a tax credit, while most others offer an annual deduction on taxable income. Some states — such as California, Maine, and Florida — offer no tax benefits to residents. In these cases, residents should consider plans based on their investment options and fees.</p>
<p>Savings in a 529 plan grow tax deferred and, if used for qualified education expenses, can be removed tax free. Saving for your children’s education is important; however maxing out any retirement account options – such as a 401k or IRA – before funding a 529 plan is likely a better choice. The tax deduction and long-term deferred growth of a retirement account tends to outweigh the shorter time horizon for the 529 account.</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">529 Plans &amp; Tax Reform</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>529 plans may be even more attractive thanks to tax reform that was signed into law in December 2017.</p>
<p>The Tax Cuts and Job Act includes a provision that allows 529 plan funds to be used to pay for qualifying elementary and secondary school expenses, as well as college expenses. So, if you plan to withdraw money from your 529 plan to help pay for private elementary or high school expenses, you can now do so without paying a penalty or taxes.</p>
<p>Before the tax reform legislation, any 529 plan withdrawals that were not used to pay for qualified college education expenses were subject to ordinary income tax and a 10% tax penalty on the earnings portion of the distribution. Now, up to $10,000 of 529 funds can be withdrawn per child each year to help cover primary and secondary private school tuition.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that while federal rules are allowing qualifying K-12 expenses with 529 plans, it doesn’t necessarily mean a plan sponsored by your state has adopted the same rules. You’ll want to <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management?c3ch=Long%20Form%20Content&#038;c3nid=Education%20Savings%20Guide">consult a professional</a> to ensure if the state-sponsored 529 plan you have conforms to the new rules before taking a distribution.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">
					<h3>529 Plans vs. Prepaid Plans</h3>
<p>Fees vary significantly by plan and tend to cover enrollment applications, account maintenance, program management, and the expenses of underlying investments. Ten-year costs on a $10,000 investment for direct-sold 529 savings plans can vary from around $100 to more than $1,500, depending on the plan and state. Some 529 plans are only sold through brokers, which typically carry higher fees relative to those available for direct purchase.</p>
<h3>Overfunding or Not Using a 529 Plans</h3>
<p>In most cases, if you are saving monthly or yearly, you may be comfortable aiming for funding 100% of total expected college costs. This way, you can reduce the amount of funding depending on how the markets are behaving and you can reap the benefits of any tax breaks earlier. If you are still concerned about overfunding or not using a 529 plan – or if you are looking to fund the 529 plan with a lump sum – it’s generally recommended that you target a 529 plan for about 70% of the total expected college costs. Then you can supplement the 529 plan with a taxable savings account until you reach the target savings amount. If you’re still concerned about overfunding, you may want to try funding only your child’s first two years of college. Then, you can use a Roth IRA or other taxable account – or your child can take out a loan – to fund the final years.</p>
<p>Remember, many children get scholarships – whether for academics or excelling at extracurricular activities – decide to go to community college for at least one year, or decide to forego college altogether. If your child receives a scholarship, you can pull the equal amount out of a 529 without penalty. If one of your children does not attend college, money can be transferred to another qualified beneficiary to be used for education – and with tax reform, this includes qualified expenses within primary and secondary private school. Qualified beneficiaries include immediate family members, relatives of your immediate family (e.g. nieces, uncles, etc.), in-laws, and first cousins.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, a 10% penalty and ordinary income tax are charged on investment gains for non-qualified distributions. There is no penalty or taxes on principal – you would only pay a penalty on gains that you have deferred for a long period of time.</p>

					<h3>PERSONAL CAPITAL STRATEGY: 529 PLANS FOR NON-COLLEGE EXPENSES</h3>
<p>If you believe you might want to withdraw some 529 funds to help pay for K-12 expenses, you may want to consider opening an additional account within your 529 plan. This will make it easier to keep track of your separate K-12 and college education savings goals and choose the most appropriate investments based on your investment horizon, risk tolerance, and withdrawal schedule.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that if you withdraw 529 plan funds to pay for K-12 expenses, this could impact your carefully laid college savings plans. Every dollar withdrawn from a 529 plan early is a dollar that won’t be there when your child is ready to start college. So think carefully before withdrawing 529 funds early, even if the money won’t be subject to a taxes and penalties.</p>

					<h3>Student Loans &amp; Aid</h3>
<p>While often burdensome, student loans have several long-term benefits and can fill big financial gaps. Loans shift the burden of repayment to your child, which helps them build credit as they pay it back. And they have the potential to protect your retirement, which should always take priority over saving for college. Remember: your children can always borrow for college; you can’t for your retirement.</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Federal Student Aid (FSA)</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p><a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about">Federal Student Aid</a> is part of the U.S. Department of Education – is the largest source of financial aid in the United States, offering loans, grants and work study funds.</p>
<p>Federals loans have flexible repayment options and universal, competitive rates. They also offer deferments and other features that most other loans don’t. Federal grants can be merit-based, need-based or student-based, and do not need to be repaid. Common ones include Pell grants, Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), and Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) grants. Keep in mind, the financial requirements for this type of aid can be very strict, and it may be difficult to demonstrate enough financial need to qualify for these.</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FSA)</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>All students filing for federal financial aid must file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).</p>
<p>A common FAFSA misperception is that it’s just for low-income families who receive financial aid; however, anyone hoping to use federal student loans for college will need to apply. Regardless of your income stream, if you’re enrolled at least half-time in a school participating in the Direct Loan Program (most schools in the United States), you’re eligible for an unsubsidized Stafford loan – and maybe more. The FAFSA process can open the door to many grants and loans.</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">State Aid</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>State governments also offer grants, scholarships, work-study funds, state loans and tuition assistance.</p>
<p>According to the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA), almost every state education agency has at least one grant or scholarship available to residents. While these student aid programs generally only apply to state residents attending an in-state school, it’s not always the case. NASFAA’s website can help you figure out which programs are available in your state and their eligibility requirements. And don’t forget, there is a lot of financial aid also available through nonprofits as well.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>Some colleges and universities provide aid to their students through scholarships, grants, and work-study programs via institutional aid programs that come from their own resources.</p>
<p>Usually these applications request much more thorough and personal information from applicants, including any special circumstances that may not have been explained on a FAFSA application. Each institution is different in what they offer, so it makes sense to evaluate these options to see what is available.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>Private loans can be a good alternative to federal loans, especially if you need to borrow a higher amount.</p>
<p>However, there are a quite a few drawbacks. Private loans tend to be more expensive, with rates averaging from nearly 4% to more than 12% annually (for comparison, top credit unions may offer members an average private student loan rate of 4.8%). These loans have interest rates and may require a cosigner and carry additional fees.</p>

					<h3>COVERDELL EDUCATION SAVINGS ACCOUNTS</h3>
<p>A Coverdell Education Savings Account (ESA) is a trust or custodial account whose sole purpose is to pay for qualified education expenses for beneficiaries under the age of 18 (or special-needs beneficiaries). Formerly known as a low-contribution education IRA, a Coverdell ESA may be used for private K-12 education expenses or qualifying college expenses (tuition and fees, books, supplies, equipment, room and board).</p>

				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>There are nearly unlimited investment options when it comes to Coverdell ESAs.</p>
<p>Most traditional mutual funds, exchange traded funds, stocks, bonds or CDs may be used inside of a Coverdell ESA. While this may provide opportunity for growth, it’s good to keep in mind that you may end up paying large fees if you work with a commission-based advisor to choose your funds.</p>

					<p>Coverdell ESAs enjoys tax benefits like a Roth IRA.</p>
<p>Money grows tax free until distributed, and may be removed tax free for qualifying expenses for kindergarten through college (although contributions themselves aren’t deductible). According to the IRS, if an account’s distributions aren’t more than your child’s qualified education expenses at an eligible educational institution, (in one year), then your child won’t owe tax on the distributions. Contributions must be made in cash and must be made by the due date of the contributor’s tax return, excluding extensions. Additionally, annual contributions are capped and have income eligibility limits for contributors. See the IRS for more information.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>While there is no limit on the number of accounts your child may have, there are limits to total contributions, which is $2,000 in 2018.</p>
<p>In addition, there are income restrictions on contributions. According to the IRS, any individual with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) for the year of less than $110,000 or any individuals filing joint returns with a MAGI of $220,000 can contribute to a Coverdell ESA. You also can’t contribute after your child reaches the age of 18, unless he or she is a special-needs child, and they work on a use-it-or-lose-it basis: the account must be fully depleted by the time your child reaches age 30.</p>

					<h3>CUSTODIAL ACCOUNTS (UGMA/UTMA ACCOUNTS)</h3>
<p>When it comes to college planning, custodial accounts – aka Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA) accounts – are another way to save for expenses. An adult, such as a parent or grandparent, is the custodian for this type of account until the child reaches the age of majority (usually 18). This means the custodian makes all investment decisions for the account. UGMA accounts can only hold money and securities while UTMA accounts can hold other types of property.</p>

					<p>There is no tax-deferred growth or “tax-free” withdrawals on custodial accounts.</p>
<p>Instead, the account will be subject to taxes as the income (interest and dividends) are earned each year. If you must sell significantly appreciated securities held in the account, again, taxes will be due on any gains. This might mean that if you start saving while your child is young, you could be faced with a large tax bill when you start liquidating assets to cover educational expenses. And while there are no contribution limits to these types of accounts, you will likely need to consider federal gift or generation-skipping transfer taxes.</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Restrictions</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>Anything transferred to a UTMA/ UGMA is considered an irrevocable gift to the minor, which means anything in these accounts will be considered the child’s assets for financial aid.</p>
<p>Child assets are more heavily weighted than parental assets when calculating the maximum financial aid available for college, impacting the potential dollar amount received if financial aid is needed. And while funds can be used to any purpose that benefits the minor, making these more flexible than 529 accounts, the minor beneficiary maintains control of assets once they reach the age of majority in their state, which means they can use the funds for anything they choose – whether that is education related.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">
					<h3>IRAs</h3>
<p>IRAs offer greater flexibility when saving for college —you maintain full control over the underlying investments. But this also means they require greater responsibility and may not be ideal for “hands-off” investors. You would be in charge of monitoring and maintaining the portfolio allocation over time.</p>

			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_toggle et_pb_toggle_62 et_pb_toggle_item  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_toggle_close">


				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Traditional IRAs</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>These accounts are tax deferred, so money is deposited pre tax, and taxes are not due on principal or earnings until withdrawal.</p>
<p>While distribution is taxed at your ordinary income rate, you can withdraw money penalty-free at any age for qualified educational expenses, such as tuition, books, fees and supplies.</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title">Roth IRAs</h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix">
					<p>These accounts are tax exempt, which means money is contributed after tax, but earnings and dividends accrue tax free (though they are subject to early withdrawal restrictions).</p>
<p>A Roth IRA may be beneficial if you’re unsure your child will attend college or if you want to maintain monetary flexibility. This makes Roth IRA a great investment option if you’re willing and/or capable of sacrificing its use as a retirement vehicle. It is important to prioritize your own retirement over paying for college – you can get a student loan for college if needed, but there’s no loan for your retirement.Keep in mind, there are investment and income limits to a Roth IRA. If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, contribute to that account before a 529 plan.</p>

					<h3>TAXABLE ACCOUNTS</h3>
<p>Like IRAs, taxable accounts offer flexibility because you control the investments. Generally, taxable accounts include individual, joint, trusts, and the aforementioned custodial accounts. Any gains realized in these accounts will be taxed in the year they were earned.</p>
<h3>STATE PREPAID TUITION PLANS</h3>
<p>Some states allow prepaid tuition plans that sometimes – but not always – let you lock in future tuition rates at in-state public colleges at current prices. The advantage is that you lock in tuition at today’s prices, which can be a huge benefit as tuitions continue to rise, even for state schools. On the other hand, you usually need to pay the current costs of tuition upfront, and since it must be used for in-state public colleges, your child is not allowed much flexibility to choose otherwise. You can lose any potential growth if your child chooses another school or receives a scholarship at a non-applicable school.</p>
<h3>SAVINGS BONDS</h3>
<p>You may be able to exclude all or a portion of the interest earned on the redemption of eligible Series EE and Series I bonds from your gross income. In order to qualify for the Education Savings Bond Program, you must be at least 24 years old before the bond’s issue date, and eligible bonds must be issued after 1989. You – or your spouse or dependents – must incur tuition and other education-related expenses at qualifying post-secondary educational institutions (i.e. they meet the standards for federal assistance) during the same tax year you redeem the bonds. When you use bonds for your child’s education, he or she can be listed as a beneficiary, but not as owner or co-owner of the bond, and there are income limitations to qualifying.</p>

					<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Planning and saving for retirement <em>and</em> your children&#8217;s education are common financial goals.</strong></span></p>
<p>They are also two of the biggest challenges for families today. How do you plan for an unknown future that requires so much upfront planning? And how do you balance the two? Here is some guidance in thinking about these two in tandem.</p>
<p><code><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b9zzJBjw0_s" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></code></p>
<h3>Prioritizing Retirement</h3>
<p>Saving for your children’s education is obviously important. But, if you’re confident your child will attend college, max out any retirement account options – such as a 401k (especially if your company matches) or IRA – before you fund a 529 or any other education-specific account. The tax deduction and long deferred growth of retirement accounts tends to outweigh the tax-free growth in your 529 for a shorter period of time. If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, you should also contribute to that account before a 529. The principal can be pulled anytime, including for education expenses.</p>
<p>As always, you should not sacrifice your retirement for your children’s education. You can always borrow for college; you can’t borrow for your retirement. When it comes to college planning, the interest rates for federal student loans – the types of loans your children might take out if they need to – are usually less than what you can make by putting your money in retirement investments.</p>
<h3>Career Projection &amp; When to Save</h3>
<p>Income varies over a career, and there are different strategies and optimal times to save for retirement vs. education. Understanding your projected career and salary trajectory helps in knowing when and how to save. After all, the salary you earned at 24 is likely not the same two decades later.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-48436" src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/180822-Average-Annual-Earnings-by-Age-300x219.png" alt="" width="600" height="438" srcset="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/180822-Average-Annual-Earnings-by-Age-300x219.png 300w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/180822-Average-Annual-Earnings-by-Age-768x561.png 768w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/180822-Average-Annual-Earnings-by-Age-652x476.png 652w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/180822-Average-Annual-Earnings-by-Age-1080x789.png 1080w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/180822-Average-Annual-Earnings-by-Age.png 1308w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>When looking at different ways to pay for your child’s education, keep in mind that you will most likely earn more later in life. So as your child grows, so will your salary, which can be important when thinking about planning for the entire family. When you are making the most money, this may be the optimal time to think about saving for both your child’s education as well as your retirement.</p>
<h3>Determining Your Retirement Goals</h3>
<p>Much of all of this is predicated on how you envision your retirement lifestyle. After all, how do you know how much you can put toward your child’s future if you don’t know how much you need for your own? It&#8217;s important to understand what kind of retirement you want. Pick a date, track your budget, know your cash flow, and remember to always look at your finances in a &#8220;big picture&#8221; way.</p>
<p>There is a huge amount of information on education, college, finance, and retirement out there. Avail yourself of what interests you, but don’t let it overwhelm you to the point that you act rashly… or don’t act at all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The third quarter was dominated by headlines surrounding trade conflicts, continued U.S./ international equity market divergence, and rising interest rates.</p>
<p>Amidst a backdrop of strong economic growth and low unemployment, U.S. stocks marched noticeably higher, shrugging off aggressive trade tactics from the Trump administration and rising interest rates.</p>
<p>International stocks underperformed their U.S. counterparts, particularly emerging markets as China slowed and fears of currency contagion weighed on shares.</p>
<p>Valuations are not especially bullish or bearish on their own. This makes it risky for those starting to get greedy and push equity allocations above long-term strategic targets, or bet big on specific stocks. We see less regard for risk overall and a common belief that the biggest tech stocks will deliver consistent double-digit gains with no material down moves. Such an environment can be perilous.</p>
<p>Apple is now worth more than $1 trillion, and Amazon hit the same mark intraday in September. They are now the two largest stocks in the world. Will they remain at the top? History suggests the odds are not in their favor.</p>
<p>On September 28, GICS (a classification system) created a new sector called Communication Services, which replaced the existing Telecommunications Services. As part of the change, certain stocks within the Technology and Consumer Discretionary sectors were reclassified into Communication Services. Personal Capital dashboards and portfolio management use GECS (a similar but distinct system).</p>
<h2>Major Capital Markets Storylines – Q3 2018</h2>
<p>The major capital markets storylines in Q3 were trade conflict, continued U.S./international divergence, and rising interest rates. U.S. stocks charged ahead (+7.1%, VTI). In doing so, they set a new mark for the longest U.S. bull market in history by some measures. Developed market international stocks also gained, albeit much less impressively (+1.5%, SCHF), while emerging markets continued their slide (-1.7%, VWO). Amid another Fed rate hike, bonds overall were flat (-0.1%, AGG).</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>For the balance of the year, trade, interest rates and earnings will likely be the primary drivers of stock prices. We don’t expect midterm elections to have a big impact. On trade, the IMF estimates existing tariffs will likely reduce global economic growth by 0.5%. That would create a headwind, but we won’t really know how accurate that is for at least a couple more quarters. It is even possible the tariffs are too small to really matter. Ten percent of $250 billion is $25 billion. That is a lot of money but doesn’t come close to moving the needle for markets overall. President Trump could always increase rates on existing tariffs, but there are not many new items left to tax.</p>
<p>Relations between China and the U.S. have soured significantly in recent months, and there is risk that either side may resort to, more dangerous methods of provocation such as product bans. Just as the end of the Cold War provided a boost to growth, a long-term deterioration between the two biggest economic powers would be a headwind.</p>
<h2>Apple and Amazon Become Trillion Dollar Companies</h2>
<p>With Apple and Amazon presently at the trillion-dollar mark, and Apple now more than 4% of the S&#038;P 500, it feels appropriate to reconsider how the biggest companies typically fare over time. In short, it is tough being at the top. According to Research Affiliates study, over the last 30 years the largest stock in the world outpaced the global stock market only about 5% of the time, delivering an annual shortfall of 10.5%. The study also showed the largest stock in each sector tends to lag, the largest stock in each country tends to lag, and that performance could be improved by simply not owning the largest stock. </p>
<p>There are three main factors at play. First, a big valuation attracts a lot of competition. Second, being big makes it harder to move and innovate. Finally, sheer size creates challenges for growth. So far, the mega-tech players have been able to beat these challenges, or buy them as Facebook did with Instagram. But maintaining this edge becomes increasingly difficult with size.</p>
<p>We don’t want to avoid the biggest companies; we simply feel there is great advantage to limiting the weight of any given stock in a portfolio, and more importantly, rebalancing back to a specific target weight. This concept works for asset classes like stocks and bonds, geographies, economic sectors and individual securities. </p>
<h2>Personal Capital Milestones</h2>
<p>Personal Capital passed $8 billion in assets under management and officially opened a new office in Atlanta. We also launched an upgraded and more personalized and tax- aware version of Retirement planner as well as <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/introducing-retirement-paycheck/">Retirement Paycheck</a>, which helps clients understand where income will come from in retirement and how to minimize the tax impact.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting to plan early around your retirement goals is a crucial ingredient for success. </p>
<p>Creating a plan early sounds straightforward enough, but decision-making can be complicated when it comes to your financial life. Retirement planning – and indeed financial planning in general &#8212; means going through the various cycles of your life that occur in different decades and setting a plan around each of these major milestones. </p>
<p>Most investors tend to procrastinate, and these planning items sneak up on them. Many people also underestimate the “real” future costs of retirement.</p>
<p>Since retirement is a major financial goal for most people, it’s important to take a step back and think about what little steps you’re taking at your age to better align your long-term goals for retirement. In that spirit, here are a few things that you should have set up or in place to address based on your age:</p>
<h2>Your 20&#8217;s: Start Contributing to Your 401k</h2>
<p>The sooner you start contributing to your 401k, the more you’ll get to benefit from the power of tax-free or deferred compounding. Many companies will have matching and if you are not contributing, you are missing out on free money.</p>
<h2>Your 30&#8217;s: Pay Down Non-Mortgage Debt</h2>
<p>This is the time to start paying down credit card debt and student loans, so you’ll enter your forties with better positioning to start building your nest egg. Make sure you have a sufficient emergency fund balance (usually six months of expenses). Consider insurance if you have started a family as well as <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/legacy-estate-planning/9-things-you-need-to-know-about-creating-a-will/">setting up wills</a> and <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/legacy-estate-planning/5-key-estate-planning-documents/">estate planning documents</a>.</p>
<h2>Your 40&#8217;s: Beef Up Your Savings</h2>
<p>This is the decade to beef up your savings and really start defining your long-term goals. Balancing retirement, college and personal or family goals. Are you on track to <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/college-planning/when-to-start-saving-childs-college-education/">pay for college goals</a>, have you revisited insurance coverage? Are your <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/average-401k-balance-age/">401k contributions maxed out</a>?</p>
<h2>Your 50&#8217;s: Make Larger Contributions Towards Retirement Accounts</h2>
<p>You are now eligible to make larger contributions towards retirement accounts. Take advantage of the catch-up provisions. If you have children, start to set priorities and expectations on how you plan to help them after college and through adulthood. Reassess how close and when you want to retire. Are the wills and estate planning documents up to date?</p>
<h2>Your 60&#8217;s: Hone in on What Retirement Looks Like for You</h2>
<p>You should have a better idea of what retirement could look like for you and what it really means for you to be “retired”. Do you want to keep working as long as you can? Would you like to slow down? What are your Social Security benefits and when is the optimal age to start taking them? At 65, make sure you visit and understand Medicare whether you intend to use it or not. Optimize your investment accounts so you are as tax efficient as possible.</p>
<h2>Your 70s and Beyond: Revisit Legacy &#038; Estate Planning</h2>
<p>Grandchildren could be a big part of starting to think about legacy and family planning. Any philanthropic goals or organization that you care about? Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) will be a factor whether you are still working or not.</p>
<h2>Working With a Financial Advisor on Retirement Goals</h2>
<p>While these are all good general guidelines for ensuring a comfortable retirement, we all know life is just not that simple. We have unexpected life events, medical expenses, decide to go back to school &#8212; there are any number of things that can complicate your financial life and your retirement planning.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Q4 got off to a rocky start, with US stocks down 1.3% (VTI) and international falling 2.7% (VEU). Interest rates spiked when Fed Chairman Powell gave an upbeat assessment of the economy and said the central bank may lift rates above the so-called neutral rate of around 3%. </p>
<p>Bonds sank globally, with the US Aggregate Bond market down 1.1% (AGG). The 10 year Treasury yield spiked to 3.19%, the highest since 2011. Tech stocks led declines after a Bloomberg report on Chinese hacking stirred increased trade fears.</p>
<h2>Weekly Returns</h2>
<p>S&#038;P 500: 2,886 (-1.0%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US (VEU): (-2.7%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 3.19% (+0.13)<br />
Gold: $1,203 (+0.6%)<br />
EUR/USD: $1.152 (-0.7%)</p>
<h2>Major Events</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tuesday &#8211; Amazon announced it would raise its minimum wage to $15, but later said it would come at the expense of some bonuses and equity compensation. Retail stocks fell. </li>
<li>Tuesday &#8211; Tesla said it met its production target for the Model 3 but is struggling to deliver the cars in a timely fashion. </li>
<li>Thursday &#8211; Bloomberg released a report saying Chinese spies hacked America’s technology supply chain. Apple and Amazon refuted the claims.</li>
<li>Thursday &#8211; The US DOJ announced an investigation into Dansk Bank and massive money laundering in Europe.</li>
<li>Friday &#8211; Mattress Firm filed for Chapter 11 and said it may close up to 700 stores.</li>
<li>Friday &#8211; The US added fewer jobs than expected but the unemployment rate fell to 3.7%, the lowest since 1969.</li>
<li>Friday &#8211; Brett Kavanaugh gained enough support to seemingly ensure confirmation to the Supreme Court.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>For the past six years, everyone has been expecting interest rates to rise. They didn’t, until now. For perspective, so far this year Three Month Treasuries are up from 1.29% to 2.16%. Ten Year Treasuries are up from 2.46% to 3.19%. This kind of move is meaningful, but not dramatic. The question is of course, what comes next and what to do about it. </p>
<p>On the bond side, the US Aggregate Bond market has generated a -2.6% total return for investors this year. No one invests in bonds to lose money, so this has naturally been disappointing. It is also somewhat uncommon. Since 1926, bonds have only lost money in 15% of years <a href="https://advisors.vanguard.com/iwe/pdf/FASMODU2.pdf">according to Vanguard</a>. It gets better if you think a little longer term. A decent estimate for five year forward annualized returns is current yield, which is now a little over 3%. That’s higher than cash and bonds also continue to provide low correlation to stocks, which makes them a great diversification tool, although this week both bonds and stocks were down.  </p>
<p>In the equity market, reactions to higher rates were schizophrenic this week. On some days, rate sensitive sectors like utilities were down, and on others they were up as investors sought safer assets. Big picture, higher rates are bad for stocks because they make bonds a more compelling alternative. The forward looking PE on the S&#038;P 500 is around 17. That equates to an earnings yield of around 6%. This is still fairly attractive given current interest rates. To keep the same spread, a further 1% increase in rates would require a forward looking PE of closer to 15. That means either stocks would have to drop by around 12%, or earnings could grow around 12%, or some combination. </p>
<p>The truth is no one knows where rates are headed and there are many more factors impacting stock prices beyond interest rates. Lately, earnings have been growing at a phenomenal rate, and they will likely continue to be the main driver of stock prices one way or the other. </p>
<p>Many investors have lost money over the past decade betting on higher rates. We feel fortunate to follow an approach that doesn’t rely on making that guess.  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>If you wait too long to set up a plan to help manage your aging parents&#8217; finances, you might encounter unnecessary problems down the line.</em></p>
<p>Talking about money can be uncomfortable, especially when you are having the conversation with loved ones or family members. However, as your parents age, we recommend having a conversation about their finances and who will manage their financial affairs if they become unable to do so.</p>
<h2>Planning Will Make Everything Easier</h2>
<p>Most children wait too long before discussing the management of their aging parents’ finances. After all, it can be hard to accept that they are getting older and may need help; and there’s no way to know how they will react to this sensitive subject. It’s no wonder procrastination becomes the path many folks choose.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, waiting can create unnecessary problems. For example, dementia becomes increasingly common as people age. And, unfortunately, people suffering from dementia are often suspicious, obstinate, and forgetful. If you think discussing finances is tough now, it will be much harder if your parent is suffering from dementia or another age-related ailment that renders them unable to manage their finances. In some cases, if a parent is unable or unwilling to have the “money conversation”, you may need court intervention. This can be costly, cause significant emotional distress, and potentially compromise your parents’ privacy, since court filings are public records.</p>
<p>Ideally, you and your parents should have the finances discussion while they can orchestrate a plan that works for everyone. For example, agreeing to sign a durable power of attorney designating an agent to manage financial affairs. A power of attorney that is “durable” continues throughout the incapacity of the parent who signed it. Importantly, some states allow a “standing” power of attorney, meaning the agent can act on financial affairs immediately. In other situations, the agent takes over upon showing incapacity of the parent, which is called a “springing” power of attorney. </p>
<h2>Serving as an Agent or Trustee</h2>
<p>In addition to a durable power of attorney, creating a living trust that designates a co-trustee or successor trustee may be recommended for when parents can no longer manage their finances. An experienced estate planning attorney can help put the appropriate paperwork in place depending on your parents’ specific economic circumstances. </p>
<p>Serving as an agent or a trustee for parents requires knowledge about the assets and liabilities within your parents’ estate. We recommend you ask your parents for a “snapshot” of their financial life. Taking a snapshot includes asking important questions so the agent/trustee can take over for the parent now or in the future.  For example, where do they keep their financial records? What accounts do they have? What bills do they have? What is their annual income and where does it come from? Do they have a mortgage? Do they have investment accounts? Who are the key professionals they work with, i.e. financial advisor, attorney, accountant, insurance agent, etc. Do they have long-term care insurance? What passwords or other codes are needed to access these various accounts? Do they have a will and a healthcare power of attorney? Where are the key documents kept?</p>
<p>You can see why putting a plan in place while everyone is still healthy is critical. If you wait until they are incapacitated and cannot help, you may need to piece together their financial affairs from clues you find around their house—and that is not guaranteed to help you find the key information when your parent is unable to help you prepare any longer. </p>
<h2>How do You Bring Up This Sensitive Topic?</h2>
<p>While early planning is critical, the subjects of money and aging can be very difficult to broach with your parents. So how do you start the conversation around this sensitive subject?</p>
<p>There is no one answer to this question – how you raise the topic to your parents will be very personal based on how you think they will react and their individual attitudes towards their finances.  Maybe you can bring up the discussion by using a friend’s situation as an example. Or mention that you recently updated your own estate plan and wondered if you can help your parents do the same. Perhaps you can approach your parents following a significant birthday or after a retirement party? Use these milestones as an opening to suggest they may need to make changes to their financial planning and they should bring you into the loop. </p>
<p>While your parents may be initially resistant, they might just need time to embrace the idea.</p>
<p>If they remain resistant, consider enlisting the help of their doctor, financial planner or accountant. Your parents may be more inclined to listen if a third party explains how important it is to discuss their finances with their children. </p>
<p>You may need to take more assertive steps—even going to court—if you see significant signs of decline that your parents refuse to acknowledge, such as changes in their hygiene habits, out-of-character behavior or confusion. Also, do not overlook the potential for elder financial abuse by other family members or caretakers. Common signs that your parents are being financially exploited include missing money/property, unexplained financial withdrawals or transfers, changes to a will or banking accounts, new bank accounts, or other suspicious activities.</p>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>While planning is helpful, if you do become your parents’ agent or trustee, you will have some rules to follow. After all, your parents’ assets still belong to them. As a result, you should consider what this responsibility entails, some basic guidelines include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Acting in their best interest</li>
<li>Managing their assets properly</li>
<li>Keeping their assets separate from your own</li>
<li>Maintaining records documenting your actions on their behalf</li>
</ul>
<p>You may want to seek guidance from an estate planning attorney or other professional who can help you perform your duties in a legally sufficient manner.</p>
<p>While you may not become your parents’ legal guardian for decades—perhaps never—everyone will feel better knowing that their financial matters are in good hands no matter what the future holds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a market-focused investor, the big news this week was the Federal Reserve’s move to raise interest rates another 25 basis points, or 0.25%. This came along with messaging that indicated expectations of a 4th rate increase in 2018 with further rate raises expected in 2019. </p>
<p>Also sharply in focus this week was the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during Thursday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. The hearing centered around allegations of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh.</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk is being sued by the Securities Exchange Commission on grounds that he may have mislead investors in his publicly traded company with his tweet about taking the company private. </p>
<h2>Weekly Returns</h2>
<p>S&#038;P 500: 2914 (+0.6%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US(VEU): (-1.33%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 3.053% (-0.36%)<br />
Gold: $1196 (-0.25%)<br />
EUR/USD: 1.16 (-1.69%)</p>
<h2>Major Events</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monday</strong> &#8211; The US signed an updated free trade agreement with South Korea. Some of the largest provisions surrounded the auto industries of both countries.</li>
<li><strong>Tuesday</strong> &#8211; President Trump spoke at a United Nations General Assembly, specifically addressing the US’s recent focus on protectionist trade measures.</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday</strong> &#8211; The Federal Reserve messaged the 3rd short term rate increase of 2018.</li>
<li><strong>Thursday</strong> &#8211; Goldman Sachs launched online consumer banking platform Marcus in the United Kingdom.</li>
<li><strong>Thursday</strong> &#8211; Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.</li>
<li><strong>Friday</strong> &#8211; Tesla’s share price opened at over 10% down from the previous night’s close based on news that the SEC was suing CEO Elon Musk over his tweet about taking Tesla private.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>The SEC seems to be specifically targeting Elon Musk rather than Tesla itself. Their suit is reported to be aimed at preventing Mr. Musk from participating in an executive position for any publicly traded US company. As of Thursday evening, it appeared that Elon will fight the case, as opposed to settling directly out of court. Tesla shares closed Friday at $264.77, down more than 12% from Thursday’s close.</p>
<p>With unemployment at record lows, and inflation sluggish in its response to a strongly performing economy (inflation is expected to increase in strong economic periods), the Fed’s message of increased rates was unsurprising to many. Still, while unemployment &#038; inflation are low, recent reports indicate that wage growth over the past few years has not increased significantly. This could be a factor in why inflation has yet to really pick up. </p>
<p>These two major events from this week illustrate a couple of the multitude of complex factors that contribute to economic growth both here in the US and globally. While our write-up this week focuses on some of the more conspicuous news points, there are other factors driving the markets. This is a point we hope all investors take to heart – it is very hard to determine exactly what will happen in the markets in the near term. The US economy looks strong now, and that very may well continue, but it also may not. As always, it’s important that investors remain disciplined in their investments, and that they understand that things can (and at some point, will) change.   </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since they were first established in 1996, Section 529 savings plans have become a popular tool used by parents to save for future college expenses. One reason 529 plans are so popular is the tax breaks they allow. As long as funds are used to pay for qualified education expenses, earnings within the account grow tax free. Also, many states allow full or partial deductions for 529 plan contributions.</p>
<h2>What is a 529 Plan?</h2>
<p>A 529 plan is a state-sponsored, tax-advantaged savings plan designed to encourage saving for future college costs. 529 plans, legally known as “qualified tuition plans,” can also be sponsored by state agencies or educational institutions and are authorized by Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code. </p>
<p>There are numerous investment options in a 529 plan account and if your child receives a scholarship, you can withdraw the scholarship amount penalty-fee and transfer the funds to another beneficiary. </p>
<p>Adversely, if you take out money from your 529 plan account to use for non-education expenses, you’ll incur federal income tax and an additional 10% penalty on the gains.  You’ll also pay applicable state taxes if you received a deduction for your contributions.</p>
<p><a id="trackExitButton" class="marketing-link-large" href="http://go.personalcapital.com/education-savings-assessment" target="_blank">Take Our Quiz: How Do Your Education Savings Stack Up Against the Average American?</a></p>
<h2>529 Plans and Tax Reform</h2>
<p>529 plans got a boost from the tax reform that was signed into law in December 2017, which includes a provision that allows 529 plan funds to be used to pay for qualifying elementary and secondary school expenses, as well as college expenses, without paying a penalty or taxes. </p>
<p>Before the tax reform legislation, any 529 plan withdrawals that were not used to pay for qualified college education expenses were subject to ordinary income tax and a 10% tax penalty on the earnings portion of the distribution. Now, up to $10,000 of 529 funds can be withdrawn per child each year to help cover primary and secondary private school tuition.</p>
<p>Note: federal rules are allowing qualifying K-12 expenses with 529 plans, but it doesn’t necessarily mean a plan sponsored by your state or educational institutions has adopted the same rules. You’ll likely want to consult a professional to ensure if the state-sponsored 529 plan you have conforms to the new rules before taking a distribution.</p>
<h2>Who Should Use a 529 Plan?</h2>
<p>529 plans are primarily geared toward families who are fairly certain the beneficiary will attend college. Most plans offer valuable tax benefits and can be an attractive option for more “hands-off” investors (assuming an aged-based option is available). But there are tradeoffs. Here are some items to look out for and be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High fees.</strong> College savings plans sold through a broker may be loaded with commissions and fees, just like any other investment product. If fees are high, the tax benefits could fade relative to purchasing low-cost ETFs elsewhere.</li>
<li><strong>Minimal control over the investment strategy.</strong> <a href="https://www.savingforcollege.com/articles/faq-on-529-investment-changes-689">According to the IRS rules</a>, you can only adjust your 529 plan investments twice a calendar year. Depending on the 529, you may be limited to a small amount of investment options to choose from.</li>
<li><strong>Minimizes your child&#8217;s financial aid eligibility.</strong> 529 plans count as an available asset when the federal government and colleges calculate financial aid.</li>
<li><strong>Living in a no-income tax state.</strong> If you live in a state that provides a 529 deduction, choosing a plan in your state likely makes sense. If not, costs matter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Front Loading Your 529 Plan</h2>
<p>High-income earners (or people with a large enough estate) can put up to five years of the annual gift exemption into their children’s 529 accounts without gift tax issues.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> When you front-load your 529 plan, your earnings will be compounded on more money over a longer time period. This means the more you put in initially, the longer that money has to grow and the greater the balance when it’s time to pay tuition. For example, you can contribute $75,000 (or $150,000 if you gift-split) into the 529 while your child is young to enjoy more years of investment growth and compounding. There is a true benefit in the ability to open a 529 plan, front load it and, at the same time, eliminate that amount from potential estate taxes. It’s also a very good use for a big bonus or inheritance.</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> With rising costs of college, it may seem very difficult to overfund a 529 plan, but it does happen. As a reminder, for your funds to be withdrawn tax-free, the money must only be used toward qualified educational expenses. If you’re concerned about overfunding, you may want to try funding only your child’s first two years of college and use other taxable accounts or loans to fund the final years.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What to Do if You Overfund Your 529 Plan</h2>
<p>Remember: many children will get scholarships, decide to go to community college for at least one year or decide not to go to college altogether. The more children you have, the greater chance at least one will not require a full four-year university. If your child gets a scholarship, you can pull the equal amount out without penalty. </p>
<p>Also, thanks to tax reform, you may also use the money for qualified expenses if you have younger children who can benefit from the funds in primary and secondary school. However, if you don’t have use for the funds in that manner, money can be transferred to another qualified beneficiary to be used for education. Qualified beneficiaries include immediate family members, relatives of your immediate family (e.g. nieces, uncles, etc.), in-laws, and first cousins.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, a 10% penalty and ordinary income tax are charged on investment gains for non-qualified distributions. There is no penalty or taxes on principal – you would only pay a penalty on gains that you have deferred for a long period of time.</p>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>529 plans are helpful and appropriate in most situations. But in some cases, there can be other ways to invest that don’t have as much of a reduction to financial aid, limit investment flexibility. Consider your situation and goals to best determine which approach makes sense for you. Overall if you choose the right 529 it can bring significant tax benefits and allows for a lot of flexibility if you need to adjust beneficiaries.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was an action-packed week. Both the DJIA and the S&#038;P 500 overcame trade war escalation to hit all-time highs, treasury yields spiked, S&#038;P sector reclassification arrived, and the Cleveland Browns finally unlocked their Bud Light victory fridges! Friday’s much anticipated trading session featured both quadruple witching (where index and stock futures and options expire) and the last chance for funds to rebalance before a major sector classification system change, but ultimately proved relatively non-eventful. International stocks, which started the month off on a down note, outperformed for the week.   </p>
<h2>Weekly Returns</h2>
<p>S&#038;P 500: 2,929 (+.85%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US (VEU): (+2.63%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 3.064% (+2.68%)<br />
Gold: $1,199 (-.48%)<br />
EUR/USD: $1.18 (+.75%)</p>
<h2>Major Events</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monday &#8211; The United States announced new import taxes of $200 billion in Chinese goods</li>
<li>Tuesday &#8211; China retaliated with a $60 billion tariff announcement on U.S. goods</li>
<li>Tuesday &#8211; Treasury yields spiked in anticipation of Fed rate hikes set for next week, with the U.S. 10-Year breaking above 3%</li>
<li>Wednesday &#8211; The EU antitrust authorities started a probe into Amazon’s treatment of merchants </li>
<li>Thursday &#8211; U.S. indices closed at all-time highs breaking the August record</li>
<li>Thursday &#8211; Comcast Corp. and 21st Century Fox opted for a weekend auction to settle the $35 billion takeover battle that has been going on for almost two years</li>
<li>Friday &#8211; Trade volume spiked as two major market trading events, quadruple witching and major index rebalancing, collided on the same trading day</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>GICS is a sector and industry classification system maintained by MSCI and Standard &#038; Poor’s. On Monday, September 24, the Telecommunications sector will be replaced with a new sector called the “Communication Services” sector that will consist of a mix of tech, media, and telecom companies &#8211;  along with some other minor reshuffling within sub-industries as well. The new sector will carry about a 10% weighting in the S&#038;P 500 and the Technology sector weighting will decline.  </p>
<p>Some of the largest stocks changing include Facebook and Alphabet, moving from the Information Technology sector to the new Communication Services sector. Netflix, Disney, and 21st Century Fox are moving from the Consumer Discretionary sector to the new sector as well. MSCI’s website states that the rapid evolution in the way people communicate and access content has resulted in the integration between telecommunications, media, and Internet companies, which is reflective in these classification changes.   </p>
<p>A key takeaway is that although there is some reshuffling going on within sector and industry classifications, the overall weighting for these stocks within major market indices are not changing and the net result should not cause significant market or stock specific movement, though some companies will see increased buying or selling pressure.  </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Personal Capital Dashboard</a> utilizes the Morningstar GECS classification system, which is similar to, but unique from, GICS. It is expected to follow suit with similar adjustments to classifications, but not until later in 2019. For Personal Capital advisor-managed accounts featuring our more diversified sector approach, there will be no immediate changes in allocations. </p>
<p>As the GECS transition plans are finalized, we will ensure a smooth transition at the right time. Technology and the ways information is exchanged have evolved. Mergers and acquisitions have further blurred the lines from traditional telecom and it makes sense for sector classifications to change as well to better reflect what is happening in the real economy. This is a positive for our process. The benefit of using a third-party classification system is it allows us to remain objective and take advantage of differences in sector behavior without emotion. Our portfolios will remain positioned to benefit from rebalancing and sector rotation over time. Our long-term advantage over capitalization weighting comes from mean reversion and cycles in sector performance.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>It takes much engineering and design to be able to model a person or family’s financial life, with all of its complexities, ambitions, changing priorities&#8211;and still be able to make it simple, intuitive and actionable for each of our customers.</em></p>
<h2>How We Use Data to Model and Optimize Your Financial Life</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software/retirement-planner">Personal Capital’s Retirement Planner</a> was our first step towards a data-driven financial app that models your financial life and finds ways to improve it based on your aspirations and long-term goals.</p>
<p>This month we released two significant improvements to how we try to model and optimize your financial life by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personalizing the model to save for and grow your portfolio, according to your specific tax situation, while you are saving for your retirement; and</li>
<li>Personalizing the model to a tax-efficient withdrawal strategy for your retirement.</li>
</ul>
<p>There were three main drivers as to why we focused on bringing you peace of mind and clarity on knowing where your income is coming from during retirement &#8211; and how much your portfolio, Social Security, and, most importantly, your taxes, will play into it.</p>
<p>As Craig Birk, our Chief Investment Officer, always says: a significant source of stress for many us is the question of what my income will be when I retire. Most of us are accustomed to a steady income, typically through our employment, so it might be hard to imagine life without it. Equally important is what the picture looks like if we run out of money.</p>
<p>In addition, most of us are also accustomed to working and paying a high level of taxes on our income. This is why many people overestimate their tax liability during retirement. The good news is, there is an answer to this question. Multiple studies (for example you can read this <a href="https://www.onefpa.org/journal/Pages/Tax-Efficient Retirement Withdrawal Planning Using a Comprehensive Tax Model.aspx">study</a> or this <a href="https://www.kitces.com/blog/tax-efficient-retirement-withdrawal-strategies-to-fund-retirement-spending-needs/">article</a>) show a good withdrawal strategy can help your money last multiple years longer. This is where tools like <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/introducing-retirement-paycheck/">Retirement Paycheck</a> can help. Retirement Paycheck is a new feature of the Retirement Planner tool and is available exclusively to Personal Capital Advisory Service clients. To learn more, <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management">contact a financial advisor</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47664" src="https://pcdailycapital.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Paycheck.png" alt="how personal capital built retirement paycheck" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/introducing-retirement-paycheck/">Retirement Paycheck</a> taps into your stream of financial data to further improve our ability to model your financial life to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project your potential retirement monthly income</li>
<li>Provide itemized income and spending goals and their source</li>
<li>Apply the right withdrawal strategies for you to maximize your financial sustainability</li>
</ul>
<p>So, we can give you clarity and confidence around your retirement years and help you achieve your financial goals.</p>
<p>However, let me take a big step back and tell you how we try to model a person or family’s financial life with these capabilities.</p>
<h2>Steps to Modeling Your Financial Life to Enable Retirement Paycheck</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Gather Fragmented Financial Data into One Comprehensive Picture:</strong> The first step is to create a <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software/net-worth">holistic view of your net worth</a> by pulling all of your assets and liabilities&#8211;from investment and mortgage accounts, to the value of your home and options in a startup company. This is the richest raw financial data set that one can have about your financial life and it’s the basis of our financial model.</li>
<li><strong>Annotate the Raw Data:</strong> We then enrich the model by creating classifiers that annotate and augment your financial data, adding more depth, quality, and accuracy. Each transaction is categorized; the type of each financial account is determined; each security is identified, valued and classified; accounts are marked as taxable vs. non-taxable, portable vs. non-portable, actively traded vs. advised accounts; and hundreds of more attributes are added on each account, transaction, or holding.</li>
<li><strong>Detect Financial Behaviors and Patterns:</strong> We then try to extract facts about typical financial behaviors: earnings and savings per year, 401k/529 contributions, debt payments, luxury expenses, saving habits, pension, and Social Security incomes.</li>
<li><strong>Add Context to the Data:</strong> Next, we provide a wide-angle view and context for your data by comparing it to the market and cohorts. We compare your investment account performance to indexes, and compare your spending, savings, and 401k contributions to your cohort based on age, industry, and risk tolerance.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t Forget the Emotional Aspect of Money:</strong> It’s easy to let the analytical and quantitative part of your money take over how we model your financial life, but the truth is, money is emotional! This is why we have added an easy way for you to add your hopes and aspirations as “goals” and “events.” For me, after we put the kids to bed, my wife and I sometimes sit around the kitchen table and bring up <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software/retirement-planner">Personal Capital’s Retirement Planner</a> and dream: what if we bought a vacation home? What if we took a year off and traveled the world? Or what if we paid for our kids’ college? You can enter each goal and see its impact on the model and your financial life. Moreover, you may also be able to schedule a call with one of our financial advisors if you have questions or need further clarification.</li>
<li><strong>Personalize Your Tax Situation:</strong> As your wealth grows, so does the complexity of your finances &#8211; namely your tax situation. An essential component of modeling your financial life is to personalize it to your particular tax situation. Our approach is to annotate and group accounts based on their tax type: tax-free, tax-deferred, taxable, and education-related. Then we model how each group grows, and show how you should save into each group, as well as when the best time is to withdraw from each group.</li>
<li><strong>Determine a Personalized Portfolio Growth Strategy:</strong> Our algorithm is designed to balance your “need,” “ability,” and “willingness” to take risks. By default, the primary goal of the model is to maximize your portfolio’s odds of meeting your financial goals. We do this by finding the best asset allocation of funds that optimize your growth rate and withdrawal rate.</li>
<li><strong>Each Year of Your Life is an Equation for the Model:</strong> I asked Song Guo, our star engineer that architected many parts of this model, what was the biggest challenge in modeling a person’s financial life? His answer was this: Managing the complications of different growth and tax strategies for different money types and then apply a personalized optimization on top of it.Each year is an equation with many variables that we need to solve. Our solution was to create a flexible data structure that can adapt to your particular situation. Once we have a flexible data structure in place, we can then slice and dice your portfolio, savings, and spending in a way that optimizes your chance of meeting all of their goals.</li>
<li><strong>Project Different Scenarios of Your Financial Life:</strong> Life is full of adventures and crossroads and <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software">using our tools</a>, you can model the financial impact of each of those adventures and decisions as a separate scenario and compare them against each other.</li>
<li>Intuitive Data Presentation: A great data-driven application can take in a significant amount of intricate and detailed financial information and distill them to a comprehensible UI that makes the data accessible to you. A financial model is not just a series of calculations, but it&#8217;s an interactive application that allows you to visualize it, explore alternative what-if scenarios, and manipulate the financial data and model assumptions intuitively to personalize it further. I recommend that you read our great UI engineer, Jeff Carey’s, <a href="https://medium.com/personal-capital-tech-blog/visualizing-your-retirement-paycheck-c1bef2cde262">post on this</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Keep it Evergreen:</strong> Because we model your financial life on top of a dynamic stream of data from the different financial institutions that you work with, this model changes with the significant changes in your life and the market. The model tries to morph with every turn of the adventure that is life. We have added built-in notifications to engage you when, say, your new spending pattern is different enough that you no longer can support your goals.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a natural flow to these steps, and if you try to visualize them, you can end up with a sequence like what you see here:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saving for your child’s college education can seem like a daunting task. Unlike with retirement savings, few clear guidelines exist. College costs vary widely depending on where your child goes to school and whether they qualify for financial aid.</p>
<p>So, how can you afford your child’s dream school, without sacrificing your own retirement fund? The key is to start saving early and identify the savings vehicle(s) that aligns best with your long-term financial goals.</p>
<h2>
College Savings Plan Options</h2>
<h3>529 Plan</h3>
<p>One of the most common ways to save money for education is the state-sponsored education savings plan: the 529. 529 plans benefit over traditional taxable accounts because their investment gains grow and can be withdrawn tax free as long as they’re used for qualifying expenses. Many states also offer additional tax benefits to local residents who invest in their respective state’s plan. While there is no limit on annual contributions, there are lifetime limits that vary by state, which are typically $200,000 or more.</p>
<p>529 plans may be even more attractive thanks to tax reform that was signed into law in December 2017.<br />
The Tax Cuts and Job Act includes a provision that allows 529 plan funds to be used to pay for qualifying elementary and secondary school expenses, as well as college expenses.</p>
<p>Before the tax reform legislation, any 529 plan withdrawals that were not used to pay for qualified higher education expenses were subject to ordinary income tax and a 10% tax penalty on the earnings portion of the distribution. Now, up to $10,000 of 529 funds can be withdrawn per child each year to help cover primary and secondary private school tuition.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, you’ll likely want to consult a professional to ensure if the state-sponsored 529 plan you have conforms to the new rules before taking a distribution.</p>
<h3>Student Loans &#038; Aid</h3>
<p>Student loans offer several long-term benefits and can fill big financial gaps. Yes, loans shift the burden of repayment to your child, and student loan debt can be a scary thing, but this method also helps them build credit as they pay it back. There are a few options if you decide there is a financial need to take out student loans or aid.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Federal Aid</strong><br />
Federal Student Aid (FSA) – part of the U.S. Department of Education – is the largest source of financial aid in the United States, offering loans, grants and work study funds. Federal loans have flexible repayment options and competitive rates. They also offer deferments and other features that most other loans don’t.</p>
<p>Federal grants can be merit-based, need-based or student-based, and do not need to be repaid. Many factors determine your aid eligibility, and the financial aid office at your college will use these to determine how much financial aid you are eligible to receive.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, all students filing for federal financial aid must file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Regardless of your financial situation, if you’re enrolled at least half-time in a school participating in the Direct Loan Program (most schools in the United States), the FAFSA process can open the door to many grants and loans.
</li>
<li><strong>Subsidized v Unsubsidized Loans</strong><br />
The federal government pays the interest on a subsidized student loan while the student is in college or if the loan is deferred. Unsubsidized loans accrue interest when the loan begins. There are borrowing maximums, depending on the year in school, including for graduate students. Interest rates and fees vary.</li>
<li><strong>State Aid</strong><br />
State governments also offer grants, scholarships, work-study funds, state loans and tuition assistance.</li>
<li><strong>Institutional Aid</strong><br />
Some colleges and universities provide aid to their students through scholarships, grants and work-study programs via institutional aid programs that come from their own resources.</li>
<li><strong>Private Loans</strong><br />
An alternative to federal loans, especially if you need to borrow a higher amount. However, these loans are more expensive, averaging 9-12% annually. Keep in mind, the interest rates for federal student loans – the types of loans your children might take out if they need to – are usually less than what you can make by putting your money in a good long-term investment strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, you should not sacrifice your retirement for your children’s education. You can always borrow for college; you can’t borrow for your retirement. The interest rates for federal student loans – the types of loans your children might take out if they need to – are usually less than what you can make by putting your money in a good long-term investment strategy. </p>
<h3>Coverdell Educational Savings </h3>
<p>A Coverdell Education Savings Account (ESA) is a trust or custodial account whose sole purpose is to pay for qualified education expenses for beneficiaries under the age of 18 (or special-needs beneficiaries). Formerly known as a low-contribution education IRA, a Coverdell ESA may be used for private K-12 education expenses or qualifying college expenses (tuition and fees, books, supplies, equipment, room and board). While there is no limit on the number of accounts your child may have, there are limits to total contributions. </p>
<p>Coverdell ESAs enjoy tax benefits similar to a Roth IRA. Money grows tax deferred and may be removed tax free for qualifying expenses, although contributions themselves aren’t deductible. According to the IRS, if an account’s distributions aren’t more than your child’s qualified education expenses at an eligible educational institution (in one year), then your child won’t owe tax on the distributions.</p>
<h3>Custodial Accounts</h3>
<p>Custodial accounts – aka Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA) accounts – are another way to save for college expenses. An adult, such as a parent or grandparent, is the custodian for this type of account until your child reaches the age of majority, usually 18. UGMA accounts can only hold money and securities while UTMA accounts can hold other types of property. As with many of these methods, custodial accounts have distinct benefits and drawbacks. </p>
<h3>IRAs</h3>
<p>IRAs offer greater flexibility when saving for college —you maintain full control over the underlying investments. But, this also means they require greater responsibility and may not be ideal for “hands off” investors. You would be responsible for monitoring and maintaining the portfolio allocation over time. This could complicate things because you would be saving for two different timelines, your retirement and college goals.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional IRAs</strong><br />
These accounts are tax deferred, so money is deposited pretax, and taxes are not due on principal or earnings until withdrawal. While distribution is taxed at your ordinary income rate, you can withdraw money penalty-free at any age for qualified educational expenses, such as tuition, books, fees and supplies. </li>
<li><strong>Roth IRAs</strong><br />
These accounts are tax exempt, which means money is contributed after tax, but earnings and dividends accrue tax free (though they are subject to early withdrawal restrictions). A Roth IRA may be beneficial if you’re unsure whether your child will attend college or if you want to maintain monetary flexibility. This makes a Roth IRA a great investment option if you’re willing and/or capable of sacrificing its use as a retirement vehicle. It is important to prioritize your own retirement over paying for college – you can get a student loan for college if needed, but there’s no loan for your retirement. Keep in mind, there are investment and income limits to a Roth IRA. If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, contribute to that account before a 529 plan.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Saving for your children’s education is obviously important, but making sure you are saving for your retirement can be even more important. Remember, your child is likely able to borrow for higher education expenses, take advantage of state grants and financial aid awards, or work a part-time job to help offset college costs. Chances are, these types of aid aren&#8217;t available for your retirement.</p>
<p>If you’re confident your child will attend college, consider maxing out any retirement account options – such as a 401k (especially if your company matches) or IRA – before you fund a 529 or any other education-specific account. The tax deduction and long deferred growth of retirement accounts tends to outweigh the tax-free growth in your 529 for a shorter period of time. If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, you should consider contributing to that account before a 529. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Global stocks rebounded over most of the week as tensions surrounding trade and EM contagion abated. Investors welcomed Treasury Secretary Mnuchin’s invitation to host additional talks with China, as well as the Turkish central bank’s decision to sharply increase rates to support its ailing currency. However, the rally flatlined on Friday due to reports that Trump wants to move forward with $200 billion in tariffs on China, regardless of the new trade discussions.  </p>
<h2>Weekly Returns</h2>
<p>S&#038;P 500: 2,905 (+1.2%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US (VEU): (+1.7%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 3.00% (+0.06%)<br />
Gold: $1,194 (-0.1%)<br />
EUR/USD: $1.162 (+0.5%)</p>
<h2>Major Events</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monday &#8211; Reports surfaced that the U.S. is working with France and the U.K. on a possible coordinated strike against Syria should its government use additional chemical weapons.</li>
<li>Tuesday &#8211; The Trump administration forced the Palestine Liberation Organization to close its office in Washington.</li>
<li>Wednesday &#8211; Apple unveiled three new iPhones, touting improvements such as faster processors, longer battery lives, and bigger screens.</li>
<li>Wednesday &#8211; U.S. median household income increased 1.8% in 2017, adjusted for inflation, although much of the increase was attributed to more work hours rather than higher wages.</li>
<li>Wednesday &#8211; It was reported that Treasury Secretary Mnuchin proposed a new round of discussions with China regarding the escalating trade war.</li>
<li>Thursday &#8211; In a defiant move to President Erdogan, Turkey’s central bank raised interest rates to help stabilize its currency.</li>
<li>Friday &#8211; Hurricane Florence made landfall on the east coast of the U.S.</li>
<li>Friday &#8211; News surfaced that President Trump wants to proceed with $200 billion in tariffs on China, despite the recent invitation for trade talks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Following a relatively wild week, markets regained their footing and moved higher as global tensions eased. Probably the most important development was the Trump administration proposing another round of discussions with China. This was viewed positively by markets, particularly since the discussions would involve more high level representatives than the last round. And it was encouraging China accepted, which follows a similar pattern of softening rhetoric from Chinese government officials. In recent weeks, they’ve made a stronger effort to reassure U.S. companies they will not be the targets of retaliation from the trade war. </p>
<p>All of this is positive, but it’s too soon to tell whether these discussions will amount to anything. Even if they do make progress, new reports suggest the Trump administration could still move forward with an additional $200 billion in tariffs. And while such a scenario could fuel global volatility, we don’t think the tariffs alone are enough to throw China into a hard landing scenario. They certainly won’t help, but China’s fate will be decided by economic conditions at home, where growth is slowing. The government is already stepping in with additional stimulus measures, but eventually it will need to tackle the mounting debt crisis spreading throughout local governments. So far China has proven fairly adept at managing these risks, but there’s no guarantee this success will continue. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>If you are forced to withdraw funds from your IRA or 401k early, it’s helpful to know the rules and regulations around early withdrawals.</b></p>
<p>401ks, IRAs and other pre-tax retirement savings accounts are common ways to save for retirement, and millions of Americans pour money into them every year. Unfortunately, many of those same Americans take early withdrawals from these accounts due to hardship, loss of a job or other unplanned circumstances. <a href="http://time.com/money/4044497/americans-raiding-retirement-savings/">According to a bankrate.com survey</a>, 17% of Baby Boomers (the generation most likely to make an early withdrawal) used their 401k plan and other retirement savings to pay for an emergency expense.</p>
<h2>The Cost of Early Withdrawals</h2>
<p>Early withdrawals from an IRA or 401k account can be an expensive proposition because of the hefty penalties they carry under many circumstances. The IRS allows penalty-free withdrawals from retirement accounts after age 59 1/2 and requires withdrawals after age 70 1/2 (these are called Required Minimum Distributions [RMDs]). There are some exceptions to these rules for 401(k)s and other ‘Qualified Plans.’ Generally though, if you take a distribution from an IRA or 401k before age 59 ½, you will likely owe both federal income tax (taxed at your marginal tax rate) and a 10% penalty on the amount that you withdraw, in addition to any relevant state income tax. That tends to add up. Given these consequences, withdrawing from a 401k or IRA early is not ideal. </p>
<p>Try to think of your retirement savings accounts like a pension. People working towards a pension tend to forget about it until they retire, because there is no way they can access it before retirement. While that money <em>is</em> locked up until later in life, it becomes a hugely powerful resource in retirement. The 401k can be a boon to your retirement plan because it gives you flexibility to change jobs without losing your savings, but that all starts to fall apart if you use it like a bank account in the years preceding retirement. Your best bet is usually to consciously avoid tapping any retirement money until you’ve at least reached the age of 59 ½.  </p>
<p>Sometimes individuals may not have the luxury of avoiding tapping into their retirement accounts, 10% penalty or no. Before you pay the penalty, be aware that there a few circumstances where the IRS grants exceptions to the 10% penalty rule.  These exceptions may make it possible for you to tap your retirement savings in a time of need without having to pay the IRS the extra penalty for the privilege. They require some planning and care to implement, so it’s best to be aware of them before the need actually arises.</p>
<h2>Retirement funds locked away?</h2>
<p>While there are many very valid reasons that you may need to dip into your retirement savings early, try not to allow this type of thinking to lead to the feeling of money burning a hole in your pocket. While retirement may feel like an intangible future event, hopefully, it will be your reality some day. So before you take any money out, ask yourself &#8211; do you actually need the money now? Think of it this way: rather than putting money “away,” you are actually “paying it forward.” If you are relatively early on in your career, your present self may be unattached and flexible. But your future self may be none of those things. Pay it forward. Do not allow lifestyle inflation to put your future self in a bind.</p>
<p>With all this talk of 10% penalties, and not touching the money until you’re retired, we should point out that there is a solution if you feel the need to be  able to access your retirement funds before you reach age 59 ½ without penalty &#8212; contribute to a <a href="http://blog.personalcapital.com/retirement-planning/roth-iras-401ks-smart-move/">Roth IR</a>A, if you qualify for one. Because contributions to Roth accounts are after tax, you are typically able to withdraw from one with fewer consequences. Keep in mind that there are <a href="https://www.rothira.com/roth-ira-limits">income limits</a> on contributing to Roth IRAs,  and that you will still be taxed if you withdraw the funds early or before the account has aged 5 years, but some people find the ease of access comforting.</p>
<p>For some folks, however, a Roth-type account is not easily available or accessible to them.</p>
<h2>Reasons For Penalty-Free Retirement Fund Withdrawals</h2>
<p>If you find yourself in a situation where you do need to withdraw funds from your 401k or traditional IRA early, there are a few circumstances in which the 10% penalty might be waived. This doesn’t include items that deal with death or complete disablement. In that case, a penalty tax is not likely to be top of your concerns.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that although these exceptions may enable you to avoid the 10% penalty, you will still owe income tax on any premature IRA or 401k distributions. Also remember that these are broad outlines. Anyone wanting to tap retirement funds early should talk to their <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/get-started">financial advisor</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Education:</strong></p>
<p>You are allowed to take an IRA distribution for qualified higher education expenses, such as tuition, books, fees and supplies. This distribution is still subject to income tax, but there won’t be an additional penalty. For instance, if you want to go back to graduate school and you need the money, you can decide to tap your retirement fund for tuition. The rule also allows you to apply this exception to your spouse, children or their descendants. Keep in mind this is for IRAs, 401ks or other Qualified Plans are subject to a different ruleset. </p>
<p>Specifically, some 401k plans will allow what is called a “hardship withdrawal,” with education expenses sometimes falling under this clause. It is important to note here that expenses eligible for a hardship withdrawal will vary depending on your 401k plan administrator, so make sure you are aware of what will qualify under your specific plan. Some providers do not allow hardship withdrawals at all.  You’ll also likely be charged the 10% fee for taking funds from your 401k early for most types of hardship withdrawals. There are a few exceptions, but education expenses are usually not one of them. Basically, hardship withdrawals mean you’re <em>able</em> to take money from your 401k before you reach age 59 ½, but most of the time you will still be hit with the penalty.</p>
<p><strong>First-time home purchase:</strong></p>
<p>You can take up to $10,000 out of your IRA penalty-free for a first-time home purchase. If you are married, your spouse can do the same &#8211; and “first-time home” is defined pretty loosely. For the purposes of the IRS, it is your first-time home if you have not had ownership interest in a home for the past two years. Just like the education exclusion, you can also tap this option for the benefit of your family. Your children, parents or other qualified relatives may receive the same $10,000 for their purchases, even if you’ve used this benefit for yourself previously or already own a home.</p>
<p>First-time home purchases or new builds may also be considered eligible for a “hardship withdrawal” from your 401k, but again, the 10% penalty will still likely apply here.</p>
<p><strong>Medical expenses or insurance:</strong></p>
<p>If you incur unreimbursed medical expenses that are greater than 10% of your adjusted gross income in that year, you are able to pay for them out of an IRA without incurring a penalty.</p>
<p>For a 401k withdrawal, if your unreimbursed medical expenses exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income for the year then the penalty will likely be waived.</p>
<p><strong>Family Circumstances</strong></p>
<p>If you are required by a court to provide funds to a divorced spouse, children, or dependents, the 10% penalty can be waived.</p>
<p><strong>Series of Substantially Equal Payments:</strong></p>
<p>If none of the above exceptions fit your individual circumstances, you can begin taking distributions from your IRA or 401k without penalty at any age before 59 ½ by taking a 72t early distribution. It is named for the tax code which describes it and allows you to take a series of specified payments every year. The amount of these payments is based on a calculation involving your current age and the size of your retirement account. Visit the IRS’ website for more ore details <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Retirement-Plans-FAQs-regarding-Substantially-Equal-Periodic-Payments">here</a>. </p>
<p>The catch is that once you start, you have to continue taking the periodic payments for five years, or until you reach age 59 ½, whichever is longer. Also, you will not be allowed to take more or less than the calculated distribution, even if you no longer need the money. So be careful with this one!</p>
<h2>What if you only need the money short term?</h2>
<p>Although there are other qualifying exceptions to withdraw IRA or 401k assets penalty-free, those listed above are the major ones. But suppose you’re not interested in paying any taxes at all. You can still use your 401k to “borrow money” via a loan &#8212; the interest goes to you, the loan isn’t taxable, and it wouldn’t show up on your credit report. Here’s how it works:</p>
<p><strong>401k loan:</strong></p>
<p>The IRS allows you to borrow against your 401k, provided your employer permits it. It’s important to note that not all employer plans allow loans, and they are not required to do so. If your plan does allow loans, your employer will set the terms. The maximum loan amount permitted by the IRS is $50,000 or half of your 401k’s vested account balance, whichever is less. During the loan, you pay principle and interest to yourself at a couple points above the prime rate, which comes out of your paycheck on an after-tax basis. Generally, the maximum term is five years, but if you use the loan as a down-payment on a principal residence, it can be as long as 15 years. Sometimes, employers will require a minimum loan amount of $1,000.</p>
<p>The benefits of such a loan are obvious: you do not need a credit check, nothing appears on your credit report, and interest is paid to you instead of a bank or credit card company. The interest rates are usually lower than what you could receive elsewhere, and the paperwork is not complex.</p>
<p>Now the downsides: If you leave your leave your employer (or are fired), your loan is generally due right away, usually within 60 to 90 days. If you can’t pay it back, you will be assessed a penalty by the IRS. You are also not able to borrow from an old 401k plan &#8212; you can only borrow from a 401k if you are still working for the employer where that 401k resides. You are also not able to borrow from an IRA if you transferred your 401k funds to an IRA. Also, taking a 401k loan depletes your retirement principal and will cost you any compounding that your borrowed funds would have received.</p>
<p><strong>IRA Rollover Bridge loan:</strong></p>
<p>There is one final way to “borrow” from your 401k or IRA on a short-term basis, and that is to roll it over into a different IRA. You are allowed to do this once in a 12-month period. When you roll an account over, the money is not due into the new retirement account for 60 days. During that period, you can do whatever you want with the cash. However, if it’s not safely deposited in an IRA when time is up, the IRS will consider it an early distribution and you will be subject to penalties in the full amount. This is a risky move and is not generally recommended, but if you want an interest-free bridge loan and are sure you can pay it back, it’s an option.</p>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Even though there are a number of ways you can withdraw from your 401k or IRA penalty-free, we always recommend not touching your retirement savings until you are actually retired. Compounding is a huge help when it comes to maximizing your retirement savings and extending the life of your portfolio, and you lose out on that when you take early distributions. To see how much compounding can affect your 401k account balance, check out our article on <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/average-401k-balance-age/">the average 401k balance by age</a>. </p>
<p>We understand that it&#8217;s always possible for unforeseen circumstances to arise before you reach retirement and being aware of the exceptions that exist can allow you to make informed decisions and possibly avoid paying extra fees and taxes. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many Americans, the decision to retire can be an exciting, but also stressful process. Retirement triggers a significant change in your daily life and introduces a level of uncertainty that comes along with forgoing an earned income. How can you transform that feeling of uncertainty into one of excitement, and what can you do to feel as prepared as possible? As you near retirement age, how do you know when it is the right time to retire? This is a highly personal decision, but here are some things to consider.</p>
<h2>Evaluate Both Financial and Emotional Components</h2>
<p>First, it is important to recognize that the decision to retire is not purely financial. The emotional component should not be overlooked. If you are unsure you are emotionally ready to retire, it doesn’t hurt to work a little longer as you take the time to decide. You can even consider working part time and easing into retirement. Just because you are financially ready does not mean it is the right time for you to retire.</p>
<p>As financial advisors, two of the most common questions we receive are: “Am I on the right track to retire at [age]?” and “Do I have enough money to retire?”</p>
<p>The answer is different for everybody. “Rules-of-thumb” and “one-size-fits-all” approaches often overlook many personal factors. Each individual must calculate the retirement-readiness equation as it applies to them. There is generally not a binary “Yes” or “No” answer. In fact, it usually ranges between the two with varying degrees of certainty.</p>
<h2>Solving the Retirement Readiness Equation</h2>
<p>From a purely financial standpoint, the equation to solve is: <em>What is the probability that your expected retirement income along with your portfolio (and its growth) will support the spending needs and desires of you and any dependents?</em> To solve most equations, you need to understand and apply the variables correctly, and this equation is no different.</p>
<p>In this case, the variables are your <strong>timing</strong> (when are you hoping to retire?), <strong>expected future income</strong> (outside of your portfolio), <strong>spending desire</strong> (required cash flow), and your <strong>portfolio characteristics</strong> (asset location, allocation, and risk tolerance). Not only do these variables form the pillars of your retirement plan, but they are also interdependent upon each other. To further complicate the equation, it is vital to understand the legal and regulatory hurdles that exist along the way.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the decision of when to retire is woven into everything from your risk tolerance to tax and regulatory considerations. Your life-expectancy and family history will play important roles as well. Somebody who does not expect to live quite as long may want to retire a little bit earlier, where-as somebody with a longer life expectancy will potentially need to consider the longer time horizon and potentially work a few years longer than “full retirement age”. It is also a highly emotional decision.</p>
<p>Any of these topics could easily be their own standalone articles, but for now, we are going to address retirement timing quite broadly. Keep in mind these are general guidelines, and that you should consult your financial advisor for your specific situation. It is important to have a plan outlining your savings and distribution strategy. Not only will creating and following a plan give you a better chance of reaching your goals in retirement, but it will also help you understand your progress towards achieving those goals.</p>
<h2>Understand the Variables</h2>
<h3>Expected Future Income</h3>
<p>The variables that most often fall into this category can be split between recurring or scheduled payments and one-time income events. Recurring events may include social security benefits, pension plans, annuities and rental income among others. One-time income events may include proceeds from the sale of a property or a downsize, an inheritance payment, a one-time distribution from a pension, or an annuity or cash value from an unneeded insurance policy.</p>
<p>Making the correct decisions from a distribution standpoint will have a material effect on the probability that you successfully reach your retirement income goals. For instance, you’ll need to consider when you will have access to these streams of income, when you should start to access them, and how much you can expect to keep after taxes. Many public pension and retirement plans will also affect how much social security you are entitled to. Additionally, at a certain point, Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) will begin to occur when you turn 70.5. It is important to plan around these as they not only can provide a source of income but may affect your tax situation as well.</p>
<h3>Spending Needs and Desires</h3>
<p>Once you’ve determined what level of income you can reasonably count on, it is important to understand what your spending will look like in retirement. Your current budget may provide a good estimate, but it should not be the final figure. Taking some time to consider what costs may change in retirement and how is a valuable exercise. You can start with any non-discretionary recurring costs that will persist indefinitely. Common examples include property tax and homeowner’s insurance or rent, utilities, food and groceries, basic maintenance, etc. You should also consider your mortgage and any other debt; if it hasn’t yet matured, you may have a significant cost for a portion of your retirement. An additional cost that many employed individuals don’t always consider is healthcare and the rules and regulations surrounding it. You’ll need to consider if you’ll be eligible for Medicare health insurance when you retire, or if you might need to shop the private market until you become eligible. Some people approaching retirement may also want to consider the future cost of long-term care if you need assistance in your later years.</p>
<p>Beyond those non-discretionary costs, many people also have other financial priorities in retirement. Many of our clients expect education costs for dependents or for themselves, for example. Oftentimes, we find that our clients may even spend <em>more</em> on things like food, vacation, or entertainment with the extra free time that comes with retirement. Furthermore, make sure to consider unexpected expenses like home repairs, car repairs, new cars, unexpected medical expenses or health care costs, etc. While these costs likely won’t occur every year, it is important to plan for them.</p>
<h3>Investment Portfolio</h3>
<p>After you’ve estimated your expected income and spending in retirement, you’ll have a better understanding of the probable discrepancy between your income and spending expectations. This gap represents the annual cash flow that your portfolio needs to generate. This cash flow, considered alongside your current portfolio, your planned future contributions, time horizon, and inflation will dictate your “required rate of return”. The required rate of return can be generated not only with traditional sources of income like bond coupons and dividends, but also with the growth of principle, also known as capital gains. If your required rate of return is likely not attainable at a level of risk you are comfortable with, you will need to adjust your retirement plan. You may need to save more, work a few years longer, or adjust your standard of living expectations before and/or during retirement.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to consider the structure and location of the assets in your portfolio. This is especially important from a regulatory and tax standpoint. Not only are the sources of income generally taxed at different rates, but so too are the different retirement savings accounts that you use to invest. Roth IRAs and Traditional IRAs are both tax-advantaged, but qualified distributions from a Traditional IRA are generally taxed at your ordinary income rate. Roth IRAs are generally tax-free. From a regulatory standpoint, you will need to be aware of the potential penalties associated with accessing your assets. For example, if you decide to retire at age 50 and the majority of your assets are in tax-advantaged retirement accounts, you may have to pay taxes and a penalty to access those funds. Such penalties can potentially cut into your portfolio’s ability to meet your goals.</p>
<h2>The Short Answer to the Question</h2>
<p>If your required rate of return is attainable at a risk level you’re comfortable with <em>and</em> you feel emotionally prepared, you are probably ready for retirement. To make this decision and determine whether your required rate of return is realistic for you, you will need to carefully examine your time horizon, expected income, desired spending, portfolio characteristics, and regulatory and tax considerations.</p>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Your decision to retire should not be spontaneous. There are many pieces of the puzzle to consider, and it may be challenging or overwhelming to navigate on your own. We believe your approach to your financial health should be like your approach to your physical health. You should develop a plan with a qualified professional and monitor that plan on a regular basis, occasionally employing the use of a specialist when it makes sense.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Excerpts from a feature (&#8220;The Journey: Mapping Life&#8217;s Financial Decisions&#8221;) originally published in the Fall 2017 edition of the quarterly magazine <strong>Confident Money</strong>. (<a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/land/subscribe-to-confident-money/?cameFrom=blog">Digital Subscriptions to Confident Money are free.</a>)</em></p>
<p>If you want to talk wealth management and financial planning, get ready. There are so many questions and so many variables involved in creating a strategy. The key to getting it right means putting all of your cards on the table – be honest with yourself about your financial needs and wants, now and in the future. And that&#8217;s usually when it hits you – the magnitude of the process. Our advisors see it firsthand when they interact with clients. Planning for what the future looks like from a financial perspective can be, well, daunting.</p>
<h2>Start Planning Early</h2>
<p>Sounds simple, right? Depends on the person, the situation and the timing. While the process can be pretty straightforward, it&#8217;s the wrapping-your-arms-around-everything part that takes some getting used to. Decision-making can be complicated when it comes to your financial life. Financial planning is basically walking through all of your life cycles.</p>
<p>Marriage. Birth. College. Real Estate. Life Insurance. Retirement. Each is an important moment and decision in the lives of most Americans. But are you ready?</p>
<p>&#8220;Most investors tend to procrastinate, and these planning items sneak up on them,&#8221; says Jonathan Lore, a Senior Financial Advisor with Personal Capital. Lore says too many consumers underestimate the “real” future costs of financial goals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Financial planning is a marathon not a sprint. If you take a holistic view, partner with the right advisor to set a strategy, then all you have to do from there is to execute the plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Formulating a strategy that works means breaking down major life events into pieces you can plan for. Here&#8217;s a look at how you can put your plan into action:</p>
<h2>Marriage</h2>
<p>Creating unity between partners is one of the biggest and most important building blocks in this life stage. The process requires combining households and making financial decisions about having two accounts or a joint one. It means getting to know each other&#8217;s families&#8217; financial tendencies. The best thing to do is identify your expectations and competence, then tailor the conversation so that both parties are comfortable with a plan moving forward together.</p>
<h2>Birth</h2>
<p>Review insurance coverage and options, employee benefits and leave policies, emergency funds. Look at daycare/early education programs to make sure you are prepared for cash flow planning/needs. Some families plan their children&#8217;s&#8217; births around daycare accommodations. Once the above issues have been addressed, and after the baby arrives, start looking at higher education and savings planning. On average, the cost of raising a child <a href="http://time.com/money/4629700/child-raising-cost-department-of-agriculture-report/">is around $234,000</a>.</p>
<h2>Life Insurance</h2>
<p>While there is no “one-size-fits-all” life insurance policy, people need insurance for a variety of reasons. While everyone’s circumstances are different, think through everything that must be taken care of if someone is left alone. This may mean replacing your annual income to cover daily living expenses for your spouse and dependents, paying off a home mortgage or other significant debts (credit cards, car loans, etc.). Paying for childcare and/or future college expenses, unpaid medical bills or taxes should also be considered. You may want to consider creating an inheritance or providing extra retirement income with a tax-free death benefit.</p>
<h2>College</h2>
<p>Wait to start saving for your child’s college until you have other priorities, such as an emergency fund, insurance, and your own retirement savings on track. It is important to ensure that your personal needs are met first. Providing for a child’s college education at the expense of your own financial well-being could mean you end up being a financial burden to your child in your retirement years. Once you&#8217;re ready, look at your options – what percent of expenses do you want to cover, are you planning for private vs. public institutions, will your child take out a student loan, etc. Identify strategies and get started. Revisit the strategy on at least an annual basis.</p>
<h2>Real Estate</h2>
<p>Understand that in terms of investments, real estate is just another illiquid asset class. Learn how much you can afford, or in the instance of an investment property, what you expect in terms of returns. Does it generate enough return to compensate you for the illiquidity premium?</p>
<h2>Retirement</h2>
<p>Understand your true spending and savings trends and complete forward-looking projections/analysis for your retirement years. See where you stand, and then what it will take to get where you need to go. Building a retirement portfolio is, essentially, the halfway point in the race. The second half is sustaining the retirement lifestyle you imagined. The key is to find a disciplined investment strategy that strikes a balance by providing the diversity, risk-tolerance, and flexibility you need. It is also important to understand where your money will be coming from when you retire and determine what income sources (retirement accounts, social security, other income sources) you will be drawing from and when to optimize your retirement income strategy. Personal Capital&#8217;s <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/introducing-retirement-paycheck/">Retirement Paycheck</a> feature is a good place to start with this.</p>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>Creating a comprehensive strategy to address these major life events is crucial for long-term financial wellbeing. Consulting a trusted financial professional is a great first step in ensuring that you are prepared for whatever the future holds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For capital markets, August was all about America. US stocks were up, the US dollar was up, and just about everything international was down. The divergence was driven by superior domestic earnings growth, upward US GDP revisions, escalating trade conflicts and sector composition differences. Currency meltdowns in Argentina and Turkey along with trade war rhetoric with China spurred selling across emerging markets, which fared worst.   </p>
<p>Market conditions have created an environment of increased temptation for investors to make the classic mistake of chasing whatever is hot. For the year, returns have been isolated to US stocks and concentrated within a narrow group. Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft and Google alone represent about 40% of gains in the S&#038;P 500 this year. In August, Apple and Amazon alone added over $300 billion in valuation, an unprecedented move. New investment flows are being largely defaulted into a narrow group of stocks, a pattern that we view as common in the later stages of a large, theme-driven sector or style cycle. </p>
<p>Asset classes, regions, styles and sectors are cyclical. Disciplined investors who remain diversified and rebalance have better prospects over full market cycles than buy and hold approaches and, more importantly, avoid the risk of carnage that comes from an inability to resist adding to positions after they have already spiked. We seek a diversified portfolio throughout market cycles, but it becomes especially important in the later phases when gains become more concentrated among fewer assets. From a valuation perspective, international and value stocks are increasingly attractive on a relative basis. We expect rewards from owning them in the years to come. It is easy to buy what has been hot and hard to own what is not, but history has proven again and again that what feels most comfortable doesn’t often end up being most profitable. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a short week of trading, all major global equity indexes finished the week with negative performance. In the US alone, a tumultuous four days were highlighted by Amazon briefly joining Apple as the second company ever to reach a 13-figure valuation, CEO’s of major technology companies testifying before congress about data security again, public attacks on large tech companies like Google and Amazon from both sides of the political spectrum, and 2 executives departing from Tesla. As has been par-for-the-course internationally for the last 6 months or so, trade discussions dominated concerns as the US, Mexico and Canada work towards replacing NAFTA. Additionally, emerging markets equities continued to sell off as fears of contagion increased.  </p>
<h2>Weekly Returns</h2>
<p>S&#038;P 500: 2871.79 (-1.0%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US (VEU): 50.52 (-3.0%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.94 (+0.08)<br />
Gold: 1196.32/oz (-0.4%)<br />
EUR/USD: 1.156 (-0.03%)</p>
<h2>Major Events</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monday &#8211; Markets Closed in observance of Labor Day</li>
<li>Tuesday &#8211; Amazon joins Apple as the second company to reach a $1 Trillion valuation (ultimately closing the week down 3.01%)</li>
<li>Wednesday &#8211; The Technology sector drops 1.5% amid regulatory concerns</li>
<li>Thursday &#8211; The MSCI Emerging Markets Index enters bear territory, down over 20% since reaching an all-time high in January</li>
<li>Friday &#8211; Tesla shares fall 6.30% after Chief accounting Officer Dave Morton resigns after 1 month on the job and videos surface of Elon musk appearing to smoke marijuana during an interview</li>
<li>Friday &#8211; President Trump signals readiness to initiate tariffs on an additional $267 Billion in Chinese goods</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Take</h2>
<p>While this market volatility may be a change from the past 2 years or so, it is normal over the long term and is something we account for when we construct investment portfolios. For context, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) which measures the implied volatility of the S&#038;P 500 index, has a historical mean is close to 20, and historical mode is between 12 and 13. We spent most of 2017 below 10 and finished this week at 14.88.</p>
<p>So, there’s certainly been an uptick in 2018, but we’re still below historical averages. This week, a good portion of volatility was driven by the “FAANG” stocks—a trend that could certainly continue given their growing weight in broad market indices. As of close of business Friday, the top 10 companies by market share in the S&#038;P 500 made up over 20% of the index, with Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Google making up over 15% by themselves. That’s a sizeable amount of concentration.  </p>
<p>This means with the recent run up of technology stocks, and FAANG stocks specifically, a cap weighted portfolio may be significantly less diversified than investors realize.  One of the core tenets behind diversification is reducing unsystematic risk, or the risks associated with one single company that do not affect the general market. This concentration can be beneficial during good times but can be disastrous during market reversals and recessions. As capitalization weighted indices concentrate more and more towards the largest companies, the levels of stock-specific risk will inherently grow as well. We’re not saying investors should completely avoid these companies, but they should at least be mindful of their exposure. Just because they own an S&#038;P 500 fund, it doesn’t mean they’re properly diversified.  </p>
<p>Emerging markets have also had a wild ride. So far, EM assets are being sold somewhat indiscriminately while developed markets have remained mostly immune. Three major influences driving volatility in emerging markets are rising US interest rates, contagion fears, and trade war scares.  Argentina and Turkey have serious problems and places like Brazil and South Africa are stagnating. However, we do not expect issues in smaller Emerging Markets countries to meaningfully impact growth in developed markets or threaten the bull market. While select countries and economies are in very bad shape, emerging economies and balance sheets in aggregate are fairly solid, especially compared with previous periods of stress. We believe emerging markets have always come with higher volatility but retain fantastic growth opportunities and diversification benefits over the long term.</p>
